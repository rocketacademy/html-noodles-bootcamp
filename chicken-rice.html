        <h3> Instructions </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To clean the chicken, rub all over with a handful of kosher salt, getting rid of any loose skin. Rinse the chicken well inside and out. Pat dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Remove any excess fat from the chicken and set aside for later.</li>
            <li>Season the chicken generously with salt. Stuff the chicken cavity with the ginger slices and scallions.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken in a large stock pot, cover with cold water by 1 inch (2 cm), and season with salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil over high heat, then immediately reduce the heat to low to maintain a simmer. Cover and cook for about 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F (75°C). Remove the pot from the heat.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the pot, reserving the poaching liquid for later, and transfer to an ice bath for 5 minutes to stop the cooking process and to keep the chicken skin springy. Discard the ginger and green onion.</li>
            <li>After it’s cooled, pat the chicken dry with paper towels and rub all over with sesame oil. This will help prevent the chicken from drying out.</li>
            <li>In a large wok or skillet, heat ¼ cup (60 ml) of sesame oil over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved chopped chicken fat, the garlic, ginger, and salt, and fry until aromatic, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reserve ¼ of the fried garlic mixture, then add the rice to the remaining fried garlic and stir to coat. Cook for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the rice to a rice cooker and add 2 cups (480 ml) of reserved poaching broth. Steam the rice for 60 minutes, or until tender.</li>
            <li>While the rice is cooking, carve the chicken for serving.</li>
            <li>Make the chili sauce: combine the sambal, Sriracha, sugar, garlic, ginger, lime juice, and chicken broth in a small bowl and stir to incorporate.</li>
            <li>Make the ginger garlic sauce: in a small bowl, combine the ginger, garlic, salt, peanut oil, and rice vinegar, and stir to incorporate.</li>
            <li>Make the soy sauce: in a small bowl, combine the reserved fried garlic and ginger with the oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, and chicken broth, and stir to incorporate.</li>
            <li>Serve the sliced chicken with the rice, dipping sauces, sliced cucumbers, and fresh cilantro.</li>
