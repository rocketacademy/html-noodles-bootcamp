Hainanese Chicken Rice Recipe<br><br>
Ingredients:<br>

For the Chicken:<br>
1 whole chicken (about 1.5 kg / 3 lbs) or 4-6 chicken thighs<br>
4 slices of ginger<br>
4 cloves garlic, smashed<br>
4-5 stalks of green onions (scallions)<br>
Salt to rub the chicken<br>
1 tablespoon sesame oil<br>
Water for boiling<br>
<br>
For the Rice:<br>
<br>
2 cups jasmine rice (rinsed)<br>
3 cloves garlic, minced<br>
2 slices ginger<br>
2 tablespoons chicken fat (or vegetable oil)<br>
2.5 cups chicken broth (from the boiled chicken)<br>
<br>
For the Sauce:<br>
<br>
Soy sauce for drizzling<br>
2 tablespoons light soy sauce<br>
2 teaspoons dark soy sauce<br>
1 tablespoon sugar<br>
3 tablespoons chicken broth<br>
Optional Chili Sauce:<br>
<br>
2-3 red chilies<br>
3 cloves garlic<br>
1 slice ginger<br>
1 tablespoon lime juice<br>
1 tablespoon sugar<br>
Salt to taste<br>
Instructions:<br>
Step 1: Prepare the Chicken<br>
<br>
Clean the chicken thoroughly and rub the skin with salt to exfoliate and remove any dirt. Rinse well.
In a large pot, bring enough water to a boil to submerge the chicken. Add ginger slices, garlic, and green onions.
Carefully lower the chicken into the boiling water. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 35-40 minutes (until the chicken is cooked through).
Once the chicken is done, remove and place in an ice water bath for 5-10 minutes (this helps to firm up the skin).
Brush the chicken with sesame oil, set aside, and keep the chicken broth for later.
<br>
Step 2: Make the Rice<br>
<br>
In a large pan, heat the chicken fat (or vegetable oil) over medium heat. Add minced garlic and ginger slices, saut√© until fragrant.
Add the rinsed jasmine rice and stir to coat with the fat. Toast for 1-2 minutes.
Add 2.5 cups of the reserved chicken broth, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and cook the rice for about 15 minutes, or until fully cooked and fluffy.<br>
Step 3: Make the Sauce<br>
<br>
In a small bowl, mix the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, and chicken broth. Stir until sugar dissolves.
For optional chili sauce, blend red chilies, garlic, ginger, lime juice, sugar, and a pinch of salt until smooth.<br>
Step 4: Assemble<br>
<br>
Carve the chicken into bite-sized pieces.
Serve the fragrant rice on a plate, topped with chicken pieces. Drizzle some soy sauce mixture over the chicken.
Serve with cucumber slices, the optional chili sauce, and a bowl of the chicken broth on the side.<br><br>
Enjoy your delicious homemade Chicken Rice!
