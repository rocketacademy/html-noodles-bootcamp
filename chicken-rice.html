    <p><strong>FOR CHILI SAUCE:</strong></p>

        consistency is achieved)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p><strong>TO MAKE THE CHICKEN:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash the chicken clean and remember to set aside the piece of chicken
        fat at the back cavity. Transfer the chicken to a plate and pat dry with
        a paper towel. Lightly rub the chicken with the salt. This will give the
        chicken skin a nice sheen. Set it aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the water, along with the ginger and scallions, to a boil in a
        large stockpot. Before adding the chicken to the pot, rinse the chicken
        under running water to wash away the salt. Carefully lower the chicken
        into the boiling water, positioning the chicken breast-side up. Now is a
        good time to adjust the water level so the chicken breast just pokes
        above the water (so you aren’t left with dry white meat).
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the water boils, carefully lift the chicken out of the water to
        pour out the colder water that is trapped in the cavity. Carefully lower
        the chicken back into the pot. Bring the water to a boil again, and
        cover the lid. Turn off the heat, and leave the pot covered on the stove
        for 45-50 minutes (set a timer). To check if the chicken is done, stick
        a toothpick into the thickest part of the drumstick. If the juices run
        clear, it’s cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the 45-minute timer (for the chicken) is almost up, prepare a large
        ice bath. Once the chicken is cooked, carefully lift the chicken out of
        the pot, drain the water from the cavity and lower it into the ice bath.
        Take care not to break the skin. After 15 minutes in the ice bath, the
        chicken should be cooled completely, drain and cover with clear plastic
        until ready to cut and serve. The ice bath stops the cooking process,
        locks in the juices, and gives the chicken skin better texture.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>TO MAKE THE RICE:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        While the chicken is cooling, make the rice. Heat a wok over medium
        heat. Add the chicken fat and render for about a minute. Stir in the
        minced garlic and fry briefly, making sure it doesn’t burn.
      </li>
      <li>Add the uncooked rice. Stir continuously for about two minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat. Scoop the rice into your rice cooker and add the
        appropriate amount of chicken stock (instead of the usual water. This
        amount may vary depending on your rice cooker) and salt. Close the lid
        and press START.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you don’t have a rice cooker, you can follow these steps. When you
        wash your rice, let it soak for an additional 20 minutes. Then drain the
        rice and follow the same steps above, but instead of transferring the
        rice mixture to your rice cooker, transfer it to a medium/large pot. Add
        3 cups of chicken stock and the salt, giving it a quick stir. Cover the
        pot and bring to a boil. Once it boils, immediately turn down the heat
        to the lowest setting. Let the rice simmer and cook (covered) for 10-15
        minutes until the rice is done. It’s not quite as foolproof as the rice
        cooker, but you should get a very similar result. Just be sure to keep
        an eye on it; burnt rice is no fun.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the rice is cooking, let’s prepare the three signature dipping
        sauces. You can also start preparing these sauces while the chicken is
        cooking in the pot.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>TO MAKE THE GINGER-GARLIC SAUCE</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Grind the ginger and garlic in a food processor until a paste forms.
        Heat the oil in a small pot or saucepan. Gently fry the ginger and
        garlic until aromatic and just lightly caramelized. You want it to be
        just cooked so that it no longer has that spicy raw flavor of uncooked
        ginger and garlic. Add salt to taste and transfer to a sauce dish.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>TO MAKE THE CHILLI SAUCE</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Grind the chilies, ginger, and garlic in a food processor until finely
        chopped. You will probably have to scrape down the sides of the food
        processor 1-2 times to ensure everything is ground up evenly. Add the
        sesame oil, salt, sugar, lime juice, and vinegar to the food processor.
        Pulse 2-3 times to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to a small bowl and add chicken broth (what you used to boil
        the chicken) 1 tablespoon at a time until a saucy consistency is
        achieved. This is really about your preference too; if you like a
        thicker paste, add less broth. The broth also helps the sauce come
        together and adds additional chicken flavour!
      </li>
