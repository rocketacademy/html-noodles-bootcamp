        Instructions
        <ol>
          <li>
            Melt butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the
            onions, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring every few minutes until
            the vegetables begin to soften; 5 to 6 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir in the garlic, bay leaves, and thyme. Cook, while stirring the
            garlic around the pan, for about 1 minute.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour in the chicken stock and bring to a low simmer. Taste the soup
            then adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Depending on the
            stock used, you might need to add 1 or more teaspoons of salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            Submerge the chicken thighs into the soup so that the broth covers
            them. Bring the soup back to a low simmer then partially cover the
            pot with a lid and cook, stirring a few times until the chicken
            thighs are cooked through; about 20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            If, during this time, the broth seems low, add a splash more stock
            or a bit of water. Turn the heat to medium-low.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate. Stir the noodles into the
            soup and cook until done, 6 to 10 minutes depending on the type of
            noodles used.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the noodles cook, shred the chicken into strips or dice into
            cubes. Slide the chicken back into the pot and then taste the soup
            once more for seasoning. Adjust with more salt and pepper, as
            needed. Stir in the parsley and serve.
