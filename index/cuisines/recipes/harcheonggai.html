        01 - In a large mixing bowl, add chicken wings, shrimp sauce, oyster
        sauce, sugar, sesame oil, Chinese wine, white pepper and salt. Stir to
        combine, ensuring each wing is coated evenly, then cover in cling film
        and allow to rest in the fridge for up to 2 days.
      </li>
      <li>
        02 - In another large mixing bowl, combine plain flour, potato starch,
        bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, eggs and water. Whisk until fully
        combined, the mixture should be runny but thick enough to hold on the
        surface of a spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        03 - Add oil to a wok over medium heat and bring up to temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        04 - Once the wings have had time to marinade, remove from the fridge
        then dip in batter. Place the battered wings in the oil in batches of 4
        and cook for 3-4 minutes until the coating crisps up and turns a golden
        brown. Be sure to test the chicken to make sure itâ€™s cooked all the way
        through.
      </li>
      <li>05 - Repeat the frying process until all wings are cooked.</li>
