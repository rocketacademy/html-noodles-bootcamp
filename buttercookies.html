     <div><b>Ingredients that you need:</b>
      <ul>
      <li>1 cup (227 g) unsalted butter </li>
      <li>½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar </li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon (0.25 teaspoon) salt </li>

    <div>
      <b> Directions:</b>
      <ol>
        <li>reheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheeting with parchment paper</li>
        <li>Beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until combined and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the salt, vanilla and egg, and beat until combined, about 1 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and gradually add the flour until mostly combined. Give a final few stirs with a rubber spatula to ensure the flour is totally incorporated (the dough will be thick).</li>
    <li>Transfer the dough to a decorating bag fitted with a large open star tip. Pipe the dough into 2-inch circles on the parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Sprinkle with sugar. </li>
  <li>Bake, one pan at a time, until light golden brown, 15 to 17 minutes. Allow to cool completely before storing or serving.</li>
