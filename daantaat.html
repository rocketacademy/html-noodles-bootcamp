    <div class="ingredient">
      <p class="subingredient">Butter Dough</p>
      <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>11 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subingredient">Water Dough</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>3 1/2 tablespoons cold water</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subingredient">Egg Filling</p>
      <ul>
        <li>5 tablespoons whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 class="subheader">Instructions</h2>
    <div class="instruction">
      <ol>
        <li>
          For the butter dough: Put the flour and butter in a food processor and
          process to a thick, smooth paste, about 2 minutes. Transfer the dough
          to plastic wrap using a metal spoon and shape into a 5-inch square.
          Chill in the refrigerator until needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the water dough: Put the flour, sugar, salt and 3 tablespoons of
          the beaten egg in the same food processor (reserve the remaining
          beaten egg for the egg filling). Pulse a few times to combine. Stream
          in the cold water while pulsing until a ball forms that is shaggy and
          not sticky, about 2 minutes. Wrap the dough into a rough square with
          plastic wrap and chill in the freezer for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the egg filling: While the doughs are resting, put the milk and
          sugar in a small pot and heat over high heat until the sugar is
          dissolved, about 1 minute. Let cool completely, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk together the eggs and reserved beaten egg in a large bowl until
          no visible egg whites remain, about 1 minute. Whisk in the evaporated
          milk, vanilla extract and cooled milk mixture. Strain the filling
          through a fine-mesh sieve twice into a 2-cup liquid measuring cup with
          a spout. Skim off any foam on the surface of the egg filling. Wrap the
          measuring cup with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator until
          needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepare the pastry: Roll the water dough on a lightly floured surface
          using a rolling pin to a 10-inch square. Position the butter dough in
          the center of the water dough in the shape of a diamond. Wrap the
          outer dough around the butter layer and seal in the edges; make sure
          to brush away excess flour with a pastry brush. Roll the dough out to
          a 6-by-12-inch rectangle. Fold both short sides toward the center and
          then fold in half like closing a book. Wrap in plastic and chill in
          the freezer for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Roll out the dough to a 6-by-12-inch rectangle with the smooth side of
          the dough to the left side. Fold both short sides toward the center
          and then fold in half like closing a book. Wrap in plastic wrap and
          chill in the freezer for 20 minutes. Repeat this process of folding
          and resting one more time.
        </li>
        <li>
          After the final 20-minute rest, roll out the dough on a lightly
          floured surface to an 11-by-14-inch rectangle, slightly thinner than
          1/4-inch thickness. Cut out 12 rounds of dough using a 3 1/4-inch
          round cutter. Stack the rounds with plastic wrap between each layer
          and chill in the freezer until firm, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Center one dough round onto each of twelve 3-inch egg tart molds and
          press the dough up the edges of each mold from the bottom to the top,
          thinning out the bottom. Put the egg tart molds on the prepared baking
          sheet. Dock the bottom of each dough round 3 times using the tines of
          a fork. Chill in the refrigerator until firm, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adjust an oven rack to the lowest position and preheat the oven to 375
          degrees F.
        </li>
        <li>
          Carefully pour the egg filling into the 12 tart shells (about 1 1/2
          tablespoons in each; there should be about 1/4 inch of space between
          the egg filling and top edges of the crust). Bake the egg tarts until
          the crusts are starting to brown around the edges, 20 to 22 minutes.
          Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue to bake
          until the crusts are light golden brown and the fillings have puffed
          slightly, 13 to 15 minutes. Let cool in the oven with the door ajar
          until the egg filling gently settles back down, about 5 minutes.
          Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack until cool enough to handle,
          about 15 minutes. Remove the egg tarts from the molds and enjoy
          slightly warm or completely cooled.
