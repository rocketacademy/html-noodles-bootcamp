    <div class="ingredient">
      <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for the pan</li>
        <li>Grated peeled daikon radish, for serving, optional</li>
        <li>Soy sauce, for serving, optional</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 class="subheader">Instructions</h2>
    <div class="instruction">
      <ol>
        <li>
          Beat the eggs, sugar, 1/8 teaspoon salt and 4 1/2 teaspoons water in a
          medium bowl until well combined but not foamy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat a 7 1/2-by-5 1/2-inch tamagoyaki pan (or an 8-inch nonstick
          skillet) over medium heat. Fold a piece of paper towel, dip it into
          vegetable oil and use it to grease the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour in enough of the egg mixture to lightly coat the bottom of the
          pan, tilting the pan as needed. Cook until the egg is just set on the
          bottom but a little underdone on the top, about 1 minute. Using
          chopsticks or a spatula (see Cook's Note), roll up the egg from the
          far end of the pan toward you. If you are having trouble getting the
          egg to fold over itself, use your fingers or a fork to help it along.
          When the egg is rolled up, push it to the far end of the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grease the exposed part of the pan with the piece of paper towel. Pour
          in enough of the egg mixture to lightly coat the bottom of the pan,
          tilting the pan as needed. Cook until the egg is just set on the
          bottom but a little underdone on the top, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
          Start with the already rolled egg at the far end of the pan and, using
          chopsticks or a spatula, roll the omelet toward you. Repeat the
          process until all of the egg mixture is cooked. (For 2 eggs in a 7
          1/2-by-5 1/2-inch tamagoyaki pan, you'll generally form about 4
          layers.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Carefully turn the rolled omelet out onto a cutting board (see Cook's
          Note) and slice crosswise into 3/4-inch pieces. Serve topped with
          grated daikon and/or a drizzle of soy sauce if using.
        </li>
      </ol>
