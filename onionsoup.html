      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p class="instructions">Caramelize the onions:</p>
          <p>
            In a 5 to 6 quart thick-bottomed pot, heat 3 tablespoons of olive
            oil on medium heat. Add the onions and toss to coat with the olive
            oil. <br /><br />

            Cook the onions, stirring often, until they have softened, about 15
            to 20 minutes.
            <br /><br />
            Increase the heat to medium high. Add the remaining tablespoon of
            olive oil and the butter and cook, stirring often, until the onions
            start to brown, about 15 more minutes.
          </p>
          <img src="images/onionsoup1.webp" alt="" />
          <p>
            Sprinkle with sugar (to help with the caramelization) and 1 teaspoon
            of salt. Continue to cook until the onions are well browned, about
            10 to 15 more minutes.
          </p>
          <img src="images/onionsoup2.webp" alt="" />
          <p>Add the minced garlic and cook for a minute more.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="instructions">Deglaze the pot with vermouth or wine:</p>
          <p>
            Add the wine or vermouth to the pot and scrape up the browned bits
            on the bottom and sides of the pot, deglazing the pot as you go.
          </p>
          <img src="images/onionsoup3.webp" alt="" />
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="instructions">Add the stock, bay leaves, and thyme:</p>
          <p>
            Add the stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring to a simmer, cover the
            pot and lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for about 30
            minutes.
          </p>

          <img src="images/onionsoup5.webp" alt="" />
          <p>
            Season to taste with more salt and add freshly ground black pepper.
            Discard the bay leaves. Add brandy if using.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="instructions">Toast the French bread slices:</p>
          <p>
            While the soup is simmering, line a sheet pan with parchment paper
            or foil and preheat the oven to 450°F with a rack in the upper third
            of the oven.
            <br /><br />
            Brush both sides of the French bread or baguette slices lightly with
            olive oil (you'll end up using about a tablespoon and a half of
            olive oil for this).
            <br /><br />
            Put in the oven and toast until lightly browned, about 5 to 7
            minutes. Remove from oven.
          </p>
          <img src="images/onionsoup6.webp" alt="" />
          <img src="images/onionsoup7.webp" alt="" />
          <p>
            Turn the toasts over and sprinkle with the grated Gruyere cheese and
            Parmesan. Return to oven when it's close to serving time and bake
            until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="instructions">Serve:</p>
          <p>
            To serve, ladle soup into a bowl and transfer one cheesy toast onto
            the top of each bowl of soup. <br /><br />
            Alternatively, you can use individual oven-proof bowls or one large
            casserole dish. Ladle the soup into the bowls or casserole dish.
            Cover with the toast and sprinkle with cheese. Put into the broiler
            for 10 minutes at 350° F, or until the cheese bubbles and is
            slightly browned.
