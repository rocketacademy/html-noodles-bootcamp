      <h2>Recipe ingredients</h2>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Heat oil in your wok over medium heat, add the scallions, and let them
          fry slowly. Once they start to turn golden brown, remove the scallions
          from the oil and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          To the oil, add both kinds of soy sauce and the sugar. Use low heat
          and cook the mixture for about two minutes, until it starts to bubble
          up.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you want to add pork to your noodles, simply brown the ground pork
          over high heat with about 3 tablespoons oil. Stir in 1/2 cup chopped
          scallions, and season with a bit of salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          This recipe serves six. Portion out the noodles into bowls, and start
          with a tablespoon of sauce (it really doesn't take much!). You can
          keep adding a bit more until the saltiness is to your liking. If using
          the pork, add a spoonful of your crispy pork and scallion mixture to
          the top, along with a small handful of the reserved fried scallions.
        </li>
        <li>Toss it all together and dig in.</li>
      </ul>
