        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) whole milk, at room temperature</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Instructions:</p>
      <ol class="instructions">
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Spray a 12-count muffin pan with
          nonstick spray or use cupcake liners. This recipe yields about 14
          muffins, so prepare a second muffin pan in the same manner or bake in
          batches and reserve leftover batter at room temperature for when the
          first batch is done.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and chocolate
          chips together in a large bowl. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk the eggs, sour cream, oil, milk, and vanilla extract together
          until combined. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and fold
          together with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until completely
          combined. (Batter is quite thick, so I recommend a spatula or spoon
          over a whisk.) Avoid overmixing. The batter will be thick and sticky.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spoon the batter into liners, filling them all the way to the top.
          Bake for 5 minutes at 425°F then, keeping the muffins in the oven,
          reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (177°C). Bake for an additional
          15-16 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out
          clean. The total time these muffins take in the oven is about 20-21
          minutes, give or take. (For mini muffins, bake 13-14 total minutes at
          350°F (177°C) the whole time.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Cool muffins for 10 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a wire rack
          until ready to eat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover leftover muffins and store at room temperature for 5 days or in
          the refrigerator for 1 week.
        </li>
