      <p><h3>Instructions:</h3></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Rinse and pat dry the duck, removing any innards in the cavity.
          Generously sprinkle the entire duck body with salt, including the body
          cavity. Set aside.
        </li><br>

        <li>
          In a small pan, roast coriander and peppercorns over medium heat until
          fragrant—2 minutes.
          <br />Combine shallots, galangal, ginger, garlic, turmeric, lime,
          salt, kaffir leaf, shrimp paste, serrano chili, sesame oil, water,
          sugar, and lemongrass into a food processor or blender, including the
          toasted pepper and coriander.
        </li><br>

        <li>
          Pulse until a loose paste forms; okay to have a few large pieces of
          ingredients. To loosen paste, add small amounts of water and scrape
          the sides if needed. Set aside.
        </li><br>

        <li>
          Over an open flame (on a gas stovetop or barbecue), prepare your
          banana leaf.
          <br />
          Carefully place a portion of the banana leaf on top of the flame.
          <br />
          When the leaf becomes fragrant, continue passing the remainder of the
          leaf over the flame until the whole leaf is fragrant and gently
          toasted.
        </li><br>

        <li>
          Lay out a long piece of foil and place the banana leaf on top; both
          should be horizontal.
          <br />The whole leaf will not fit and some will be hanging off the
          edge.
        </li><br>

        <li>
          Move the duck to the banana leaf and smother one side with a generous
          portion of paste.
          <br />
          Place the duck lengthwise and paste side down onto the center of the
          banana leaf, leaving about 1 foot of leaf to wrap around (wrapping the
          duck is similar to wrapping ingredients into a burrito). <br />
          Spread the remaining paste onto the duck and begin to wrap the
          duck—fold the 1 foot of banana leaf over the duck and roll until the
          duck is wrapped in the leaf. <br />
          Note, the banana leaf will not cover rear and the head.
        </li><br>

        <li>
          Fold the foil over the duck and tuck in the edges. Repeat this step
          with three more layers of foil, making sure the duck is sealed.
        </li><br>

        <li>
          Preheat grill to 350 degrees, the place duck in the center. Roast for
          3 hours, or until the internal temperature reads 175 degrees on the
          thicker part of the leg.
        </li><br>

        <li>
          Carve or shred the duck with a fork and serve hot with cooked juices
          and paste, with rice, cucumber, or tomato.
        </li>
      </ol>
