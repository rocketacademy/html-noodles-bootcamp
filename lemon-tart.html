        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>For the crust:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat over to 400°. Generously spray a 9-inch tart pan with a
            removable bottom with baking spray. Rub with a paper towel to make
            sure all the surfaces are well coated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine the butter, oil, water and salt in a microwave-safe bowl.
            Cover the bowl with a plate or some damp paper toweling. Microwave
            on high power for 3 minutes. Carefully remove the bowl from the
            microwave (it will be hot) and allow to cool for 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the sugar to the warm butter mixture and stir to combine. Then
            add the flour and coconut. Mix until well combined (I use a silicone
            spatula or wooden spoon) and the dough comes together and forms a
            ball.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer the dough to a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom (you
            could also use a 9-inch pie pan). Break up half of the dough into
            small walnut size pieces and line them up around the edges of the
            pan. Press the dough around the edges of the pan, forming a crust
            about ¼-.inch thick and even with the top of the pan. Then press the
            remaining dough firmly into the bottom of the pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until a light,
            golden brown. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool partially
            while you make the lemon filling.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>For the lemon filling:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a large microwave-safe bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolks,
            sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice and salt (⅛ teaspoon if using
            unsalted butter) until smooth. Add butter cubes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Microwave on high power for 45 seconds. Remove from the microwave
            and stir vigorously with a whisk. Continue to cook at 45-second
            intervals, stirring after each interval. It will take 4-7 minutes,
            depending on the power of your microwave. Lemon curd is done cooking
            when it coats the back of a metal spoon. You can also check it with
            an instant thermometer. It’s done when it reaches 175˚F.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove from the microwave and whisk well. Pour the lemon mixture
            into a fine-mesh sieve with a bowl set underneath. Stir and allow
            the mixture to be strained into the bowl. Keep stirring until all of
            the lemon mixture has been strained. Discard any solids in the
            sieve. (I like to do this in my sink as it gives me a good angle to
            stir from.) This step is optional but makes for a silky smooth
            filling. If you don’t have a fine-mesh sieve, just proceed with the
            next step.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour the lemon filling into the prepared crust, smoothing the top.
            Bake in the preheated oven for 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and
            allow the tart to cool completely. It will be wobbly when it’s warm
            but will set nicely for slicing once it’s cooled. Serve with a
            sprinkle of powdered sugar, a dollop of whipped cream, fresh fruit
            and/or a drizzle of raspberry coulis. ENJOY!
