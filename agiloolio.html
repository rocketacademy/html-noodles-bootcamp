    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Spaghetti: Or linguine, fettuccine, or any other shape of pasta noodle
        you prefer.
      </li>

      <li>
        Olive oil: Since olive oil is the main ingredient in this sauce, I
        really recommend using the best-quality extra virgin olive oil you can
        find. It will make a difference!
      </li>

      <li>
        Garlic: I admittedly like tons of garlic in this pasta (like, closer to
        10-12 cloves). But it is traditionally made with between 4-8 cloves. So
        you do what sounds best to you!
      </li>

      <li>
        Crushed red pepper flakes: Traditional spaghetti aglio e olio is made
        with fresh peperoncini (red hot chile peppers) that are commonly found
        throughout Italy. But since they are harder to find in other countries,
        I have written this recipe using dried crushed red pepper flakes, which
        we will simmer in the olive oil to bring out their best flavor.
      </li>

      <li>
        Optional garnishes: The two most popular toppings for this classic
        Italian dish are finely-minced fresh parsley and/or freshly-grated
        Parmesan. I love adding both, but they are totally optional.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the spaghetti. Cook the spaghetti in a generously-salted pot of
        boiling water until it is just one minute shy of being al dente.
      </li>

      <li>
        Sauté the garlic. Meanwhile, about 3 minutes after you add the pasta to
        the boiling water, heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium
        heat.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add the sliced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes and sauté for 3 to 5
        minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden.
      </li>

      <li>
        Toss the pasta in the sauce. Once the pasta is ready to go, use tongs to
        transfer the pasta immediately to the sauté pan, along with 1/2 cup of
        the hot starchy pasta water.
      </li>

      <li>
        Toss the pasta continuously until it is evenly coated in the garlic
        sauce. If the sauce looks a bit too dry, add in another 1/4 cup of the
        starchy pasta water.
      </li>

      <li>
        Taste and season. Give the pasta a quick taste add an extra pinch of
        salt and/or crushed red pepper flakes if needed.
      </li>

      <li>
        Serve. Serve immediately while it’s nice and hot, garnished with any
        toppings that sound good.
      </li>
    </ol>
