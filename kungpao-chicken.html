    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a teaspoon of oil in a wok over medium heat and add a cup of raw
        shelled peanuts. Stir constantly (or they’ll burn) for 3 minutes. Turn
        off the heat and stir for another minute using the residual heat in the
        wok.
      </li>

      <li>
        Set aside to cool. They will turn crunchy once they’re cooled
        completely.
      </li>

      <li>
        Combine the chicken with 1 teaspoon each of oil, cornstarch, and
        Shaoxing wine, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of white pepper. Set aside
        to marinate for 20 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Mix together light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sugar,
        water, and cornstarch, and set aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok over high heat. Sear the chicken, remove
        from the wok to a bowl, and set aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        Turn the heat to low and add another tablespoon oil. Add the garlic,
        ginger, chilies, Sichuan peppercorn powder, and scallions. Cook for a
        minute or two until fragrant.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add the chicken back to the wok. Turn up the heat to high and stir-fry
        for a minute. Then stir up your prepared sauce (the cornstarch will have
        settled to the bottom, so make sure it’s well incorporated). Add the
        sauce to the wok and stir-fry for another minute. The sauce should
        thicken very quickly.
      </li>

      <li>Finally, add the peanuts.</li>

      <li>Give everything a final stir and serve.</li>
    </ol>
