    <h3>Preparation time: 30 minutes</h3>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
      <li>1 small Vidalia onion peeled and finely diced</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves peeled and minced</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper)</li>
      <li>22 ounces cherry tomatoes halved</li>
      <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 handful of basil leaves roughly chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instructions</p>

      <li>
        In a large pan, set over medium heat, add the olive oil. When the olive
        oil is warm, add the diced Vidalia onions and few generous pinches of
        salt. Give it a mix and let them cook, covered, for 7 minutes. You
        really want the diced onions to melt in the pan with the olive oil. I
        like to make sure the heat is low enough so they slowly cook and donâ€™t
        brown or burn.

        Next, add the minced garlic, crushed red pepper flakes and cherry
        tomatoes. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, covered, until the tomatoes
        are softened and have released a lot of their juices. Uncover and cook
        for an additional 5 to 7 minutes, until it thickens. Turn off the heat
        while we make the pasta.

        Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook your pasta until
        al dente. I usually cook it about 1 minute before al dente because I
        like to finish cooking the pasta in the pan with the sauce. Reserve
        about 3/4 cup of pasta water. Drain the pasta and turn your attention to
        the pan with the cherry tomatoes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        To the sauce, add about 1/2 cup of pasta water and bring it to a rapid
        simmer. Cook for about 2 minutes; give it a taste and adjust the salt to
        taste. I added a few more pinches of salt. Add the pasta in, along with
        the butter and toss together for about a minute, until completely
        combined.
