				<h3>Method</h3>
				<ul>
					<h4>
						<bold>step 1</bold>
					</h4>
					<li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
					<h4>
						<bold>step 2</bold>
					</h4>
					<li>
						Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely
						grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.
					</li>
					<h4>
						<bold>step 3</bold>
					</h4>
					<li>
						Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little
						freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.
					</li>
					<h4>
						<bold>step 4</bold>
					</h4>
					<li>
						Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the
						water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered,
						for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).
					</li>
					<h4>
						<bold>step 5</bold>
					</h4>
					<li>
						Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just
						to bruise it.
					</li>
					<h4>
						<bold>step 6</bold>
					</h4>
					<li>
						While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic.
						Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon
						as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.
					</li>
					<h4>
						<bold>step 7</bold>
					</h4>
					<li>
						Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often,
						until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted
						its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.
					</li>
					<h4>
						<bold>step 8</bold>
					</h4>
					<li>
						Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready,
						lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the
						frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in
						the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta
						water away yet.
					</li>
					<h4>
						<bold>step 9</bold>
					</h4>
					<li>
						Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful
						back for sprinkling over later.
					</li>
					<h4>
						<bold>step 10</bold>
					</h4>
					<li>
						Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly
						pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up
						the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which
						thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.
					</li>
					<h4>
						<bold>step 11</bold>
					</h4>
					<li>
						Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons
						should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a
						little salt, if needed.
					</li>
					<h4>
						<bold>step 12</bold>
					</h4>
					<li>
						Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate
						or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining
						cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little
						dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the
						glossy sauciness will be revived.
					</li>
