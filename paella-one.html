        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Produce: onion, bell pepper, garlic, tomatoes, parsley, frozen peas.
          </li>
          <li>Spices: bay leaf, paprika, saffron, salt and pepper.</li>
          <li>
            Saffron: this may be the most important ingredient, so it’s best to
            buy high quality. If your grocery store doesn’t carry it, try an
            International food market, or Amazon. If necessary, substitute 1
            teaspoon saffron powder.
          </li>
          <li>Seafood: jumbo shrimp, mussels, calamari.</li>
          <li>
            Chicken thighs: I prefer thighs to breasts in the recipe since they
            don’t dry out as easily during longer cook times.
          </li>
          <li>Olive Oil: Spanish olive oil , or any good quality olive oil.</li>
          <li>White wine.</li>
          <li>
            Spanish Rice: See my notes below about the rice, and possible
            substitutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Chicken Broth: Authentic paella would include making your own fish
            stock from the discarded shells of seafood. I usually substitute
            chicken broth, for convenience.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Sauté: Add olive oil to a skillet over medium heat. Add onion, bell
            peppers and garlic and sauté until onion is translucent. Add chopped
            tomato, bay leaf, paprika, saffron, salt and pepper. Stir and cook
            for 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Add white wine. Cook for 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>
            Add chicken & rice. Add chopped parsley and cook for 1 minute.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add broth. Pour the broth slowly all around the pan and jiggle the
            pan to get the rice into an even layer. (Do not stir the mixture
            going forward!). Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low.
            Give the pan a gentle shake back and forth once or twice during
            cooking. A skillet with sautéing vegetables, chicken and rice, then
            broth added to make paella.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook uncovered: Cook paella uncovered for 15-18 minutes, then nestle
            the shrimp, mussels and calamari into the mixture, sprinkle peas on
            top and continue to cook (without stirring) for about 5 more
            minutes. Watch for most of the liquid to be absorbed and the rice at
            the top nearly tender. (If for some reason your rice is still
            uncooked, add ¼ cup more water or broth and continue cooking).
            Paella rice cooking in a pan, then mussels, shrimp and calamari
            added.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover and let rest. Remove pan from heat and cover pan with a lid or
            tinfoil. Place a kitchen towel over the lid and allow to rest for 10
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Serve. Garnish with fresh parsley and lemon slices. Serve.</li>
