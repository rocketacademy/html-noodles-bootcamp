        <li>5 ounces (150 g) dried narrow flat rice noodles</li>
        <li>2 to 3 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>
          About 1/2 teaspoon organic sugar, or 1 teaspoon maple syrup (optional)
        </li>
        <li>Pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>
          Optional extras: Bean sprouts, mint sprigs, Thai basil, cilantro

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Peel then slice the ginger into 4 or 5 coins. Smack with the flat side
          of a knife or meat mallet; set aside. Thinly slice the green parts of
          the green onion to yield 2 to 3 tablespoons; set aside for garnish.
          Cut the leftover sections into pinkie-finger lengths, bruise, then add
          to the ginger. <br />
          Coarsely chop the leafy tops of the cilantro to yield 2 tablespoons;
          set aside for garnish. Set the remaining cilantro sprigs aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a 3- to 4-quart (3 to 4 l) pot, toast the coriander seeds and clove
          over medium heat until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the ginger and
          green onion sections. Stir for about 30 seconds, until aromatic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slide the pot off heat, wait 15 seconds or so to briefly cool, then
          pour in the broth. <br />
          Return the pot to the burner, then add the water, cilantro sprigs,
          chicken, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat
          to gently simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
          After 5 to 10 minutes of simmering, the chicken should be firm and
          cooked through (press on it and it should slightly yield).
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue to simmer the broth without the chicken for another 15 to 20
          minutes (for a total of 30 minutes simmering time).
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the chicken to a bowl, flush with cold water to arrest the
          cooking, then drain. Let cool, then cut or shred into bite-size
          pieces. Cover loosely to prevent drying.
        </li>
        <li>
          Soak the rice noodles in hot water until pliable and opaque. Drain,
          rinse, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the broth is done, pour it through a fine-mesh strainer
          positioned over a 2-quart (2-liter) pot; line the strainer with muslin
          for superclear broth. Discard the solids. You should have about 4
          cups. <br />
          Season with fish sauce and sugar (or maple syrup), if needed, to
          create a strong savory-sweet note.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring the strained broth to a boil over high heat. Put the noodles in
          a noodle strainer or mesh sieve and dunk in the hot broth to heat and
          soften, 5 to 60 seconds. Lift the noodles from the pot and divide
          between the 2 bowls. [Emma's note: I didn't find it necessary to
          soften my noodles any further. I just added them to the bowls and
          poured the hot broth over top. However, dunking them in the broth
          would make them more flavorful!] <br />
          Lower the heat to keep the broth hot while you arrange the chicken on
          top of the noodles and garnish with the chopped green onion, cilantro,
          and a sprinkling of pepper. Taste and adjust the brothâ€™s saltiness one
          last time. Return the broth to a boil and ladle into the bowls. Enjoy
          with any extras, if you like.
