      <p>Instructions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Pat chicken dry with paper towels; sprinkle with salt and pepper. In a
          6-qt. stockpot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken in
          batches, skin side down; cook until dark golden brown, 3-4 minutes.
          Remove chicken from pan; remove and discard skin. Discard drippings,
          reserving 2 tablespoons.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add onion to drippings; cook and stir over medium-high heat until
          tender, 4-5 minutes. Add garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Add broth,
          stirring to loosen browned bits from pan. Bring to a boil. Return
          chicken to pan. Add celery, carrots, bay leaves and thyme. Reduce
          heat; simmer, covered, until chicken is tender, 25-30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer chicken to a plate. Remove soup from heat. Add noodles; let
          stand, covered, until noodles are tender, 20-22 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, when chicken is cool enough to handle, remove meat from
          bones; discard bones. Shred meat into bite-sized pieces. Return meat
          to stockpot. Stir in parsley and lemon juice. If desired, adjust
          seasoning with additional salt and pepper. Discard bay leaves.
        </li>
      </ol>
