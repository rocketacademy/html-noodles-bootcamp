              <u>YOU WILL NEED:</u><br>
              <ul>
              <li>Chicken – I use chicken thighs for convenience (easier than man handling a whole chicken) but you can use a whole chicken too. Do not sub with breast – we need to use dark meat here, and we need skin to maximise flavour into the broth!</li>

<li>Leftover chicken – We use some chicken to top the soup, but you will have leftovers – and it will be infused with lovely flavour! See bottom of post for things to use it for;</li>

<li>Spices – cloves, fennel, star anise, coriander (fresh and seeds) and cinnamon – infuse the broth with the distinct Pho fragrance that you know and love so well!</li>

<li>Onion and ginger – these are aromatics that are charred first to add a hint of smokiness to the broth. A traditional and mandatory inclusion!</li>

<li>Fish sauce – this provides more complexity and depth of flavour than soy sauce, as well as salt in the broth;</li>

<li>Sugar – Pho broth is actually a bit sweet. Most people don’t realise it because it’s subtle! But it’s there – and if you don’t use enough sugar, you will notice something lacking in the broth ; > </li>
