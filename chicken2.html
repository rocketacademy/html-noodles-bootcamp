        <li>
          Melt butter in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add
          onion, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender,
          about 3-4 minutes. Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk in chicken stock and bay leaves; season with salt and pepper, to
          taste. Add chicken and bring to boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered,
          until the chicken is cooked through, about 30-40 minutes. Remove
          chicken and let cool before dicing into bite-size pieces, discarding
          bones.

          salt and pepper, to taste.
