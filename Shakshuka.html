      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and bell
        pepper and saut√© until softened, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add garlic, cumin, paprika, and cayenne pepper and cook for another
        minute, stirring constantly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the can of whole peeled tomatoes with their juices and use a
        wooden spoon to break them into smaller pieces. Bring the mixture to a
        simmer and cook until the sauce has thickened, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a spoon, make 6 small wells in the sauce. Crack an egg into each
        well and season with salt and pepper.

        Cover the skillet and simmer until the egg whites are set but the yolks
        are still runny, about 10-15 minutes.

        Garnish with chopped fresh parsley or cilantro and serve hot with crusty
        bread or pita.
