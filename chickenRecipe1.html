        <li>
          Rinse the fresh egg noodles with cold water, drain the excess water
          and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a small mixing bowl, marinate the chicken with all the all the
          seasonings in the Marinade, for 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat up a wok with 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil. When the wok is
          heated, add the chicken into the wok and pan-fry the chicken until
          slightly charred and blackened on both sides. Remove the chicken from
          the wok and into a bowl. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clean the wok and heat it up with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil.
          Add in the minced garlic and stir-fry until light brown or aromatic.
          Add the shredded cabbage and carrot into the wok and do a few quick
          stirs. Stir in the noodles, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and water.
          Continue to stir fry until the noodles are well blended with the
          seasonings and completely cooked through. Dish out and transfer into
          two serving bowls. Top the chicken noodles with the chicken (and its
          juice), garnish with the sesame seeds and scallion. Serve immediately.
