    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Chicken thighs. I prefer skin-on pieces for their richer flavour.
        Skinless pieces are fine too.
      </li>

      <li>
        White rice. I usually use jasmine rice. Short grain white rice works
        too.
      </li>

      <li>
        Scallions, ginger and garlic. The classic aromatic trio is used to
        flavour both the rice and the sauce.
      </li>

      <li>
        Light soy sauce, lime and sesame oil. Theyâ€™re used to enhance the taste
        of the sauce. Add some chopped fresh chilli if you like a little kick of
        heat.
      </li>

      <li>
        Cucumber. You may also serve other vegetables on the side, e.g. blanched
        Bok Choy, Gai Lan, etc.
      </li>

      <li>Neutral cooking oil</li>

      <li>Salt and whiter pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Coat the chicken thighs with salt and white pepper. Leave to marinate
        for 10 minutes or so.
      </li>

      <li>
        Over medium heat, fry finely chopped scallions, minced ginger and garlic
        in oil until fragrant.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use a spoon to transfer about â…” of the fried aromatics to a small
            bowl to be used as the sauce.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Add rinsed and drained rice. Stir fry for about half a minute to coat
        the grains evenly with the oil. Pour in water and add a little salt. Use
        a spatula to scrape off any rice stuck to the bottom of the pot.
        <ul>
          <li>
            ðŸ›Ž NOTE: When using a stovetop pot, the rice water ratio in VOLUME is
            about 3:4. For making about 4 servings, I use 1Â½ cups of rice and 2
            cups of water.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Place the chicken pieces flat over the rice without overlapping. Leave
        the pot uncovered and let the water come to a very gentle boil (small
        bubbles appear on the surface).
      </li>

      <li>
        Then cover with a tight lid and turn the heat down to the lowest. Leave
        to cook undisturbed for 20 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        When the time is up, turn off the heat and let it sit for a further 10
        minutes. Donâ€™t skip this resting process as the heat inside the pot will
        continue to cook the rice and chicken.
        <ul>
          <li>
            ðŸ›Ž TIP: If using an electric burner of which the temperature doesnâ€™t
            go down immediately, remember to remove the pot from it to avoid
            burning the food.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove the centre bone of the chicken thighs then cut them into
        bite-sized strips. Scoop out the rice and put it on individual serving
        plates. Place the chicken on the side, along with sliced cucumber.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remember the fried aromatics you saved earlier? Stir in some light soy
        sauce, fresh lime juice and a dash of sesame oil to form a sauce. Add
        finely chopped fresh chillies if you like some heat.
      </li>
    </ol>
