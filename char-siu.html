    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 lb pork shoulder</li>
      <li>1 tbsp garlic salt</li>
      <li>4 tbsp brown sugar</li>
      <li>tbsp oyster sauce</li>
      <li>2 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tbsp hoisin sauce</li>
      <li>2 tbsp red wine</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Shaoxing wine</li>
      <li>1 cube red fermented bean curd</li>
      <li>1 tsp five spice powder</li>
      <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
      <li>2 tsp water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Methods</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Step 1</b><br />
      Prepare & poke meat: Cut the pork shoulder (2 lb) into long slices,
      roughly about 1 inch thick. We'll aim to cut each slice with uniform
      thickness so they cook at the same rate. Afterwards, we'll repeatedly poke
      each side of each slice with a fork to help the pork absorb our marinade
      more effectively.
      <br /><br />
      <b>Step 2</b><br />
      Prepare marinade: To a bowl, we'll add: garlic salt (1 tbsp)​ brown sugar
      (4 tbsp)​ oyster sauce (2 tbsp)​ light soy sauce (2 tbsp)​ hoisin sauce (1
      tbsp)​ red wine (2 tbsp) Shaoxing wine (1 tbsp) red fermented bean curd (1
      cube) five spice powder (1 tsp) This amount can be adjusted based on the
      amount of pork you'll be making. Mix the marinade until it's evenly
      distributed and smooth. If you'd like a more rich, red color, you can add
      a few drops of red food coloring (0.25 tsp).
      <br /><br />
      <b>Step 3</b><br />
      Marinate pork: Place the meat into a ziploc bag, pour the sauce in, and
      massage the pork for about 2 minutes so that the sauce is able to finesse
      its way into the meat. Afterwards, we’ll push all the air out of the bag
      and seal it. Place the bag in the refrigerator, and let the pork marinate
      overnight (or around 6 to 8 hours.) Some notes: My dad says to not let it
      marinate for over 24 hours, or else it will affect the tenderness of the
      meat. If you're planning on cooking it on the same day, then you don't
      need to place it in the refrigerator. The pork will stay fresh due to the
      marinade. If you refrigerated the pork, let it sit for about 1 hour to
      bring it to room temperature before starting to cook it.
      <br /><br />
      <b>Step 4</b><br />
      Prepare char siu for oven: Preheat the oven to 425° F or 218° C. Set up
      the baking pan by lining the bottom with aluminum foil (so it's easier to
      clean!), and place the baking rack on top of the foil. Using tongs, start
      laying out the pork on the baking rack + pan. Add 1-2 tbsp of water to the
      bottom of the pan to help generate some steam as the char siu cooks, and
      to help prevent the drippings from burning and smoking. Carefully place it
      in the oven.
      <br /><br />
      <b>Step 5</b><br />
      Repeat several cycles of cooking and basting char siu. Now, we’ll be
      placing the pork into the oven and taking it out periodically to lather it
      again with either our leftover pork marinade, or honey (2 tbsp) diluted
      with water (2 tsp). Here’s how my dad split up the cooking time: Cook for
      15 minutes and lather both sides with the pork marinade Cook for another
      15 minutes and lather both sides with pork marinade again Cook for 10
      minutes and lather both sides with the diluted honey And finally, we’ll
      turn the heat up to 450° F, cook for another 5 minutes, lather both sides
      with honey, and let it cool for a few minutes before cutting into it. In
      total, this was about 50 minutes in the oven.
      <br /><br />
      <b>Step 6</b><br />
      Final touches, let cool, cut & enjoy! <br />
      Once the char siu has finished its last cycle in the oven, we'll lather
      each side with our diluted honey. Let the char siu cool for about 5
      minutes before cutting into it.
