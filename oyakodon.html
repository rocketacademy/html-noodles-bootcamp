      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>To Prepare the Seasoning</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine ½ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock), 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp
          mirin, and 2 tsp sugar in a bowl or a liquid measuring cup and mix all
          together until the sugar is dissolved.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>To Prepare the Ingredients</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Slice ½ onion lengthwise, about ¼ inch (6 mm) wide.</li>
        <li>Chop 4 sprigs mitsuba (Japanese parsley) ½ inch (1.3 cm) wide.</li>
        <li>
          Trim the extra bits of fat and connective tissue from 10 oz boneless,
          skinless chicken thighs with the knife.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cut the chicken thigh along the grain into strips ¾–1 inch (2–2.5 cm)
          wide. Next, angle your knife back and diagonally (nearly parallel to
          the cutting board), and then slice the chicken strips against the
          grain into pieces about ¾–1 inch (2–2.5 cm) square. This sogigiri
          cutting technique gives the chicken pieces equal thickness and creates
          more surface area for fast cooking and better absorption of the
          flavors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the chicken to a bowl or tray and sprinkle with 1 Tbsp sake.
          Set aside for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Crack 3–4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) into a bowl. Using a pair
          of chopsticks, lift the egg whites to “cut“ them 5–6 times into a few
          smaller clumps. This will prevent the egg whites from falling into the
          frying pan all at once. Do not whisk or beat the eggs together. Tip:
          Aim for high color contrast between the white and yellow parts of the
          eggs in your finished dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          While “cutting“ the egg whites, you may have accidentally broken some
          of the egg yolks. That‘s okay. If the yolks haven‘t broken yet, you
          can poke them to gently break them, but do not blend the egg whites
          and yolks. The eggs should resemble a marble pattern.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>To Cook the Oyakodon in a Medium Frying Pan</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          With the stove off, add the sliced onions to a medium frying pan in a
          single layer. Then, add the seasonings mixture. It should just cover
          the onions. If not, your frying pan is too big and you need to either
          increase the seasoning or use a smaller pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn on the heat to medium and bring it to a simmer. Once simmering,
          add the chicken on top of the onions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure the onions and chicken are evenly distributed. Once
          simmering again, lower the heat to medium low. Cook, uncovered, for 5
          minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink and the onions are
          tender. Halfway through, flip the chicken. Tip: Evaporation reduces
          the sauce and intensifies the flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will add the eggs in two stages: Two-thirds of the eggs first, then
          the remaining one-third later. Now, increase the heat to medium. With
          the cooking liquid simmering (small bubbles around the edges), drizzle
          two-thirds of the eggs in a circular pattern over the chicken and
          onions, avoiding the edges of the pan where the eggs can easily
          overcook. Tip: Only drizzle the eggs if the cooking liquid is
          simmering, as with Egg Drop Soup. Also, try to add more egg whites at
          this stage, as the whites take longer to cook than the yolks. Ideally,
          we want to keep the yolks soft and runny for the final presentation.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the heat is too strong, lower the heat. If the egg is moving toward
          the edges of the pan, gently gather it toward the center where the
          heat is not as strong. Optionally, you can cover the pan if the egg
          whites are taking a long time to set.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the eggs are still runny but just set, add the rest of the eggs
          to the center and around the edges of the pan. Add the mitsuba (or
          green onion) on top and cook on medium low until the egg is done to
          your liking. Usually, oyakodon in Japan is served while the egg is
          almost set but still runny (raw eggs are safe to consume in Japan).
          Tip: For the remaining one-third of the egg, try to distribute more
          egg yolks so the oyakodon will have a bright yellow color on top. For
          a good presentation, you can add a beaten extra yolk at the end.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve steamed rice in individual serving bowls. Spoon the cooked
          chicken and egg mixture onto the steamed rice and drizzle the desired
          amount of pan sauce on top.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>To Serve</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Serve the Oyakodon with optional shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven
          spice) for a spicy kick and Japanese sansho pepper for a peppery
          fragrance on the side.
