          Heat up a wok with the cooking oil until it begins to smoke. Add the
          scallion strips and stir continuously with the spatula until the
          scallions are aromatic and becomes moderately burned. (This process
          will release the full fragrance of the scallions and infuses the
          scallion oil with the intense aroma.) Set aside the scallion oil.

          Heat up a pot of water until it boils. Cook the fresh noodles al
          dente. The noodles should be cooked through but still somewhat firm
          and springy. Drain the noodles and transfer into a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the scallion oil, oyster sauce and soy sauce into the noodles.
          Using a pair of chopsticks, toss the noodles to blend well with the
          scallion oil and seasoning sauces. Serve immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
          To serve, add the noodles in a bowl, and top with the shredded chicken
          on top. Ladle the soup on top of the noodles and top with the garlic
          oil. Serve immediately. If you like, you can serve it with cut red
          chilies in soy sauce.
