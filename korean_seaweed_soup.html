    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak the dried seaweed in cold water for 5 to 10 minutes while allowing
        it to expand. Drain the water away and rinse the seaweed a couple of
        times in running water. Drain/squeeze the water out. (If youâ€™re using
        non pre-cut dried seaweed, cut it with scissors â€“ about little finger
        lengths). Set it aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the sliced beef with the salt and black pepper in a small bowl.
        Mix them well and set aside until needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pre heat a medium pot over medium heat (about 20 seconds). Add the
        sesame oil, seaweed and beef. Stir them well until the beef is partly
        cooked (about 2 mins). Add the soy sauce, garlic and water. Cover the
        pot and boil over medium â€“ medium high heat until the meat is fully
        cooked (10 to 15 mins). Adjust the taste with more salt if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve warm with a bowl of steamed rice and other Korean side dishes.
      </li>
    </ol>
