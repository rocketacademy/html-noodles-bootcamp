      <p>To Prepare the Ingredients</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cut 2 onions into wedges. I like to have the texture of the onions in
          my curry, so I cut them into thick wedges. If you prefer, you can
          mince or thinly slice the onions so they disintegrate into the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Peel 2 carrots and cut them into rolling wedges (it‘s called rangiri
          in Japanese). This type of cut creates more surface area, which helps
          the carrots absorb more flavor and cook faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          Peel 3 Yukon gold potatoes and cut them into quarters. Soak them in
          water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch. Tip: Yukon gold potatoes
          hold their shape well. You can use russet potatoes, but they tend to
          disintegrate into the broth during cooking, so cut them into 6 pieces
          each and add to the pot toward the end of cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and measure 1 tsp ginger
          with the juice. Set aside. Mince 2 cloves garlic and set aside (I use
          a garlic press later when adding to the pot).
        </li>
        <li>Cut ½ apple into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin.</li>
        <li>
          Grate the apple and set aside. Note: You also could use 1 small
          lunchbox apple for 8 servings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cut off the extra fat from 1½ lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs and
          discard it. Then, cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. I recommend
          cutting it diagonally (it‘s called sogigiri in Japanese) to create
          more surface area and flatten each piece so it cooks faster. Season
          with freshly ground black pepper. Tip: If you will use homemade curry
          roux, you can lightly season the chicken with kosher salt as well.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>To Cook the Curry</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat 1½ Tbsp neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the
          onion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent
          and tender, about 5 minutes. Don‘t stir the onions too often because
          they won’t develop a golden color. Cooked onions add amazing flavor,
          so we do not want to skip this step. If you have an extra 5 minutes,
          definitely caramelize the onions!
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the minced garlic (I pass it through a garlic press for a finer
          texture) and grated ginger and mix well together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it‘s no longer
          pink on the outside. If the onions are getting too brown, reduce the
          heat to medium low temporarily.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add 4 cups chicken stock/broth. To reduce the sodium, you can
          substitute with water only or use half stock and half water, if you
          prefer. Tip: If you‘re using my homemade curry roux, you don‘t need to
          worry as it does not contain salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the grated apple, 1 Tbsp honey, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp
          ketchup (or any condiment you choose to add). Please read my blog post
          for details.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the carrots and Yukon gold potatoes (if you‘re using russet
          potatoes, add them later in the last 15–20 minutes of cooking). The
          broth should barely cover the ingredients. Don‘t worry; we don‘t want
          too much liquid here, and additional liquid will be released from the
          meat and vegetables.
        </li>
        <li>
          Simmer, covered*, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring
          occasionally. *Simmer uncovered if the ingredients are completely
          submerged in the broth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once boiling, use a fine-mesh strainer to skim the scum and foam from
          the surface of the broth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue to cook covered until a wooden skewer goes through the
          carrots and potatoes.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>To Add the Curry Roux</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Turn off the heat. From 1 package Japanese curry roux, put 1–2 cubes
          in a ladleful of cooking liquid. Slowly let it dissolve with a spoon
          or chopsticks and stir into the pot to incorporate. Repeat with the
          rest of the blocks, 2 cubes at a time. Tip: I use 1 full-sized box of
          store-bought curry roux, which is typically for 8–12 servings (be
          careful, as some brands offer a smaller box, which is 4 servings).
          With my homemade curry roux, I typically use 6–7 cubes for 8 servings
          (about 80% of the curry roux mixture if it hasn‘t solidified yet).
        </li>
        <li>
          Simmer, uncovered, on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the
          curry becomes thick, about 5–10 minutes. If your curry is too thick,
          you can add water to thin the sauce. When you stir, make sure that no
          roux or food is stuck to the bottom of the pot; otherwise, it may
          burn.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you use my unsalted homemade curry roux, taste the curry now and
          add salt to your liking. Tip: I recommend adding 2–4 tsp Diamond
          Crystal kosher salt, but this will vary based on the brand of the
          chicken broth and condiments you added.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>To Serve</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Serve the curry with steamed Japanese short-grain rice on the side. If
          you like, garnish with fukujinzuke (Japanese red pickled vegetables).
        </li>
      </ol>
