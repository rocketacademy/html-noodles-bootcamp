      <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>

      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan until
        shimmering. Add the onion, carrot, celery, and pancetta and cook over
        moderate heat, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil to the saucepan and heat
        until just shimmering. Add the beef, veal, and pork and cook over
        moderately high heat until just barely pink, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the tomatoes and their juices, the chicken stock, thyme, and bay
        leaf. Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and bring to a
        boil over high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover partially and cook over moderately low heat for 1 hour. Discard
        the bay leaf. Stir in the heavy cream and cook the sauce just until
        heated through.
      </li>
      <li>Serve the pasta in deep bowls and pass the Parmesan at the table.</li>
