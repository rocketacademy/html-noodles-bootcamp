      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p class="instructions">Fry the potatoes:</p>
          <p>
            Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan or skillet or griddle until
            it shimmers. Put the potatoes in the pan in one layer and fry on
            medium-high heat for 2 to 3 minutes without touching them.
            <br /><br />
            Use a metal spatula to scrape the potatoes off the bottom of the
            skillet, flipping them. Sprinkle salt over the potatoes, and cook
            for another 2 to 3 minutes without touching them.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="instructions">
            Brown the peppers and onions, add back the potatoes:
          </p>
          <p>
            Remove the potatoes, which should be partially browned, to a bowl
            and set aside. Increase the heat to high and add the peppers and
            onions. Arrange evenly in the pan and cook for 2 to 3 minutes
            without touching them.
            <br /><br />
            Sprinkle salt over them, then flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes
            untouched. There should be some browned and even blackened bits here
            and there.
            <br /><br />
            Add the Italian seasoning and the potatoes to the pan, stir to
            combine and cook over medium-high heat until they are soft and
            nicely browned, about 8 to 10 minutes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="instructions">Grill the hot dogs:</p>
          <p>
            Heat a grill or a frying pan to cook your hot dogs; don't boil your
            dogs for this recipe. Grill or fry until they are done to your
            liking and set aside.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="instructions">Assemble:</p>
          <p>
            Liberally smear mustard on both sides of the sandwich roll. Add two
            hot dogs per roll and top with as much of the potatoes, peppers and
            onions as will fit. Serve at once.
