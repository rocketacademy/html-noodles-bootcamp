      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          For the noodles: Cook the noodles according to the package
          instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the sauce: Stir together the fish sauce, brown sugar, tamarind,
          sriracha and lime juice in a small bowl until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the stir fry: Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium
          heat. Add the tofu and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly
          browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Push the tofu to the side, allowing the
          excess oil to drip down into the middle of the skillet. Add the
          chicken and shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until the
          chicken is opaque and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Push to the side
          with the tofu, allowing the excess oil to drip down into the middle of
          the skillet. Add the beaten egg to the skillet and cook, stirring
          occasionally and chopping to break up, until cooked through, about 30
          seconds. Push the egg to the side with the tofu and chicken. Add the
          peppers to the skillet and cook just to soften slightly, about 2
          minutes. Add the noodles, bean sprouts, scallions and sauce to the
          skillet. Combine the tofu, chicken and egg into the ingredients and
          stir fry, coating the ingredients with the sauce, and simmer to
          thicken, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pile the stir fry onto a serving plate and top with chopped peanuts
          and cilantro leaves. Serve immediately with lime wedges.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Cook's Note</h2>
      <p>
        Pad Thai cooks up very fast one you get the heat going. Be sure to have
        all your ingredients cut and measured out and your sauce mixed before
        you start cooking. Tamarind paste is a puree of the fruit without the
        seeds and fibers. You may also find tamarind concentrate, in which case
        you'll want to dissolve it in 1 tablespoon of hot water first. If you
        have thicker, large scallions, slice them in half lengthwise before
        cutting into pieces.
