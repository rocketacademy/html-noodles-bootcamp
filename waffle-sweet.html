        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <li>300g Plain flour</li>
        <li>150g Caster sugar</li>
        <li>2Â½ tsp Baking powder</li>
        <li>250ml Milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp Vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 Eggs large</li>
        <li>200g Butter melted</li>
      </ul>

        <li>
          Put the butter into a saucepan and melt it over a low heat, remove
          from the heat and set aside
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn on your waffles maker so it can heat up, I put mine on the max
          heat setting, but all waffle makers are different
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large mixing bowl, add the plain flour, caster sugar and baking
          powder. Stir them together until well combined
        </li>
        <li>
          In another bowl, or a jug, add the milk, eggs and vanilla extract.
          Gently whisk them together until combined
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture, whisking as you pour,
          and keep whisking until the batter is smooth
        </li>
        <li>
          Then add the melted butter bit by bit, whisking between each addition,
          until the batter is smooth and shiny
        </li>
        <li>
          I prefer to transfer the batter into a jug so I can easily pour it
          into my waffle maker, but you can also use a spoon to spoon it into
          the waffle maker as well
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour some of the batter into your waffle maker, you want the little
          squares to be covered but still just about visible through the batter.
          If you're not sure how much to, it's better to add too little and then
          increase the amount as you go. If the batter does spill out the sides
          don't worry, just wipe it away
        </li>
        <li>
          Gently close the lid of the waffle maker, do not push it down. The
          waffles will take around 4-5 minutes, but you can check on them from 3
          minutes
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the waffle is cooked to your liking, carefully remove it from the
          waffle maker, I use silicone tongs to do this, and place on a cooling
          rack
        </li>
        <li>Repeat until all of the batter is used up</li>
        <li>
          The waffles will seem soft when you first remove them from the waffle
          maker, but they will crisp up quickly as they start to cool
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve immediately, or allow to cool and store in the fridge or freeze
          them to enjoy another time
        </li>
      </ol>
