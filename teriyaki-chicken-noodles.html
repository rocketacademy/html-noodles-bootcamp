      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <h3>Preparation:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Wash and peel (optional) the carrot, and cut them into thin slivers
          and set aside
        </li>
        <li>
          Wash and cut the cabbage into half, and then cut each half into half
          again so you get ¼ of a cabbage. Use only ¼ of the cabbage. Cut out
          the core of the cabbage and cut them into thin slices and set aside
        </li>
        <li>
          Cut off the ends of the onion and then peel it. Cut the onion in half
          and then place the onion flat side down on the cutting board and cut
          them into thin slices and set aside
        </li>
        <li>
          Peel and finely chop the garlic. Set aside 1 tablespoon for the sauce
          and set the rest of it a side for the stir fry.
        </li>
        <li>Grate the ginger and set aside later for the sauce</li>
        <li>Hand shred, or thinly slice the leftover chicken and set aside</li>
        <li>
          Place a frozen brick of udon noodles into a colander and run it under
          cold water to melt the ice. Once the noodles are soft and pliable (it
          should take about 1-2 minutes), they are done. Set it aside
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Making the Teriyaki Sauce</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Set a small pot on the stove on medium-low heat</li>
        <li>
          Add a bit of oil to it. Once the oil is hot, add in the garlic and
          ginger and toast it until it is brown (approximately 1-2 minutes)
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the garlic and ginger has browned, add in the soy sauce, water
          and honey and let it simmer for 1-2 minutes
        </li>
        <li>
          While the sauce is simmering, mix the corn starch and cold water
          together to make a corn starch slurry and mix well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the sauce has simmered for a few minutes, stir the sauce quickly
          with a utensil while adding in the corn starch slurry slowly. Keep
          stirring until the sauce thickens.
        </li>
        <li>Once the sauce thickens, set it aside for later.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Putting Everything Together</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Use a large frying pan and set the stove to medium to medium high
          heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add 2 tablespoons of oil to the frying pan and wait for it to get hot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add in the onions and cook them
          until they are soft (approximately 1-2 minutes)
        </li>
        <li>
          Then add in the carrots and cabbage and stir fry it with the onions.
          Try to leave it on the pan for 20-30 seconds without touching it every
          minute to give the cabbage a bit of a char. Cook everything for
          approximately 3-4 minutes or until the vegetables are soft.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add in the garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes - we put the garlic
          last so it doesn't burn.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add in the chicken and mix everything together and cook for another
          1-2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add in the noodles and cook for 1 minute</li>
        <li>Add in the sauce and cook everything for 1 minute</li>
        <li>Once everything is all cooked, plate it and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
