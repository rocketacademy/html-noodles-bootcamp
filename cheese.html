  <p class='emphasis'>You can make this noodle with chicken breast, very lean pork or even beef. Noodles made of pork or beef will be even firmer and chewier. Just make sure that the meat has very little to no fat and all the silver skins, tendons and connective tissues are removed.</p>

  <p>This dough can be used in any other noodle recipes. Although more work, you can cut them thinner, or even make them into your favorite pasta shapes. Read the instructions carefully for applications.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>NOODLE DOUGH:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>7 oz (200 grams) chicken breast, or very lean pork or beef</li>
      <li>1/4 heaping tsp sea salt</li>
      <li>1 cup tapioca flour/starch</li>
      <li>1/4 cup boiling water</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
    </ul>

    <p>FETTECCINI ALFREDO:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 cloves of garlic, grated</li>
      <li>2 sprigs of fresh thyme</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1/4 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tbsp Greek yogurt</li>
      <li>2 tsp fish sauce</li>
      <li>1/8 tsp freshly grated nutmeg</li>
      <li>Freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano to serve</li>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <div class='recipe-steps'>

    <h2>Clues</h2>
    <p>MAKE DOUGH:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Dice the chicken breast (or lean pork or beef) into small pieces and place in a food-processor with sea salt.</li>
      <li>Run the processor for 1~2 minutes until the meats are pureed into a pink goo-like substance. </li>
      <li>Meanwhile in another bowl, pour the boiling water into the tapioca flour. Use a spoon to mash and mix until an even, dry and shaggy mixture forms. Add the flour-mixture into the food-processor, along with 2/3 of the cornstarch, and pulse until a dough-like mixture forms. </li>
      <li>The dough should be slightly sticky, leaving just a little bit on your fingers when you tap on it. If it's stickier than that, add the rest of the cornstarch and pulse again.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>SHAPE DOUGH</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Because of the texture of this dough, it will not do well and may be caught stuck in an electric pasta roller/maker. But don't worry because it's easy to do by hand.</li>
      <li>Transfer the dough onto a working surface dusted with more tapioca flour to prevent sticking. The dough should feel moist but not overly sticky. Shape the the dough into a thick log, then roll it out into a rectangular sheet about 1/16" (1.5 mm) thick.</li>
      <li><span class='emphasis'>It's important that you keep BOTH SIDES the dough well floured with tapioca as you go.</span> Instead of dusting, scatter the flour onto and smooth it out across the surface on both sides as you go.</li>
      <li>Keeping it well floured, fold the sheet by half lengthwise, then half again, and cut 1/2" (1 cm) segments across the width. Because of the fibrous texture, use a sharp knife and do it in a slicing motion.</li>
      <li>Once done, unfold the noodles gently, undoing the first fold, then the second fold, and leave them laying separated on the counter as they are.</li>
      <li>DO NOT fluff them or curl them up like you'd do with normal noodles because again, this dough breaks more easily.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>TO COOK:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of water with a hefty pinch of salt to boil like you would cooking pasta. </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium high heat and bring unsalted butter to a sizzle, add garlic, thyme and ground black pepper and cook for a few seconds until fragrant. </li>
      <li>In another pot, bring heavy cream, whole milk, Greek yogurt, fish sauce, grated nutmeg and a hefty pinch of grated Parmigiano to a simmer. Stir to combine and turn off the heat and set aside.</li>
      <li>Once the water comes to a rapid boil, gently transfer the noodles into the pot. <span class='emphasis'>Gently stir around with a wooden spoon to prevent sticking,</span> and cook for about 30 seconds more after the noodles have floated to the top. </li>
      <li>Transfer the noodles with a strainer and into the skillet. Return the skillet to medium-high heat and cook until the cream has thickened slightly.</li>
      <li>Drizzle the garlic/thyme butter over the top and serve immediately with more grated cheese.<span class='emphasis'>Voil√†.</span> </li>
    </ol>
