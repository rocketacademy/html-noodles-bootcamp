Kung Pao Chicken
This dish is quite hot, yet you can adjust the amount of chilies and suit your preference to mild or little hot in home cooking anyway.

Ingredients:

200g chicken breast, diced
1/4 capsicum, diced
50g peanuts
3 to 4 garlic, sliced
6 dried chilies, roughly chopped
a dash of Shaoxing wine
Marinade:

2 tsp light soy sauce
1 tsp cornflour
1 tsp Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
1/2 tsp sugar
A dash of sesame oil
A pinch of pepper
Seasoning:

1 tsp light soy sauce
1 tsp cornflour
1/2 tsp sugar
1 tsp Hoisin sauce 
1 tbsp water
1 tsp white vinegar
Sesame oil, to taste
Method:

Marinade diced chicken for 30 minutes.
Bake peanuts in a preheated oven (180C/356F) for 3 to 5 minutes until lightly brown. Don’t let them unattended. Or you might like to deep fry peanuts in hot oil. Note that the peanuts will continue to turn darker after draining out from hot oil. Set aside
Heat oil in a wok or frying-pan. Sauté garlic and dried chilies over medium heat until aromatic. Toss in marinated chicken and stir-fry until the outsides turn white. Sprinkle wine and stir quickly. Add capsicum and cook until softened. When the chicken is cooked through, add seasonings. Turn heat to high and cook until sauce dries up a bit. Sprinkle peanuts. Dish up and serve hot.
