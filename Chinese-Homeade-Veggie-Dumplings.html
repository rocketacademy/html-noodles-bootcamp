        <p>
          A delicious vegetarian or vegan dumpling is hard to find, not a lot of
          people make them and even less of them make it well. Most are filled
          with lots of processed elements such as tofu or dried radish, which
          doesn’t have much texture nor flavor. My mom’s been making her version
          of vegan dumplings ever since I can remember, since this is a family
          tradition. I must have watched her made these over a hundred times but
          this is actually the first time that I’ve ever made it from head to
          toe on my own. (Probably because she always think that I’m not fast
          enough) There are millions of dishes out there but I think this
          dumpling is the only one that really brings me home every time I taste
          it.

        </ul>
        <h4>SEASONING</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>5 TBsp Soy Sauce</li>
          <li>4 TBsp Sesame Oil</li>
          <li>1 TBsp Sugar</li>
          <li>1 TBsp Freshly Grated Ginger replace with ginger powder</li>
          <li>2 tsp Ground White Pepper</li>
          <li>1 tsp Salt or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>WRAPPER</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>500g Ap Flour</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
          <li>250g - 300g Water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Bring a medium pot of water to boil.</li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, toast the sesame seeds in a small skillet over medium
            heat, stirring often (keep an eye on them, as they can burn
            quickly). Once they’re fragrant and turning golden, transfer them to
            a small bowl so they don’t burn. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the water is heating, clean and chop the cabbage into 8
            wedges, spinach into 2" pieces so it's easier to blanch.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the cabbage to the pot of boiling water to blanch for 10
            seconds, spinach for 5 seconds. Drain and let cool. The reason the
            veggie has to be blanched ahead is to control how much water there
            is in the dumplings. Soggy veggies are dumplings enemy. By blanching
            the veg, it's softened and excess water can be squeezed out later.
          </li>
          <li>
            While waiting for the veggies to cool, chop the tofu skin, soaked
            mushrooms(Squeeze the juice out) and cellophane noodles into roughly
            5mm pieces. Carrots need to be chopped slightly finer than that. Mix
            all the chopped ingredients in a large mixing bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the blanched veggies are cool enough to handle, chop them up
            into 5mm pieces then move to a nut milk bag/ laundry bag/ cheese
            cloth and squeeze out about 80% of the water. That's abstract, I
            know. I usually squeeze mine with both hands until the veggies clump
            together and forms a ball without falling apart easily and not too
            soggy to touch.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the squeeze veggie to the mixing bowl and mix in the seasoning:
            5 TBsp Soy Sauce 4 TBsp Sesame Oil 1 TBsp Sugar 1 TBsp freshly
            grated ginger 2 tsp ground white pepper 1 tsp salt (or to taste) Mix
            well. The best part about making vegan dumplings is that you can
            taste it and adjust accordingly!
