      Instructions:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir
          sausage, mushrooms, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic in hot oil
          until sausage is browned and crumbly, about 20 minutes; drain and
          discard grease.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and olives into
          sausage mixture; season with oregano, basil, and salt. Simmer mixture
          until flavors infuse, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
          boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to
          the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a serving bowl; top
          with tomato-sausage sauce and Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
      </ol>
