        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <div class="cooking">
          <li>
            1. Make dough: Combine egg, oil, and salt in a liquid measuring cup;
            add enough warm water to fill to 1 cup. Pour into a large bowl and
            knead in 3 cups flour until smooth and elastic. Cover with a dish
            towel and let dough rest for 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            2. Meanwhile, make filling: Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt,
            and pepper in a medium bowl; mix thoroughly by hand or using a fork.
            Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour; set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            4. Roll out a portion of dough very thinly on a lightly floured
            surface; keep remaining dough covered with a dish towel to avoid
            drying out. Cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter. Place
            about 1 teaspoon filling on one side of each dough circle. Fold
            dough over and seal the edges using your fingers, forming a
            crescent. Join the ends and pinch them together. Place on the
            prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
            Freeze pelmeni for 30 minutes to prevent them from sticking
            together.
          </li>
          <li>
            5. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer. Working in
            batches, cook frozen pelmeni in simmering water until meat is cooked
            through and pelmeni float to the top, about 5 minutes. Continue
            cooking for 5 more minutes. Transfer to serving plates using a
            slotted spoon.
