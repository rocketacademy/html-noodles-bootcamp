    <p><b>Preparation time:</b> 20 mins</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tbsp instant coffee</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Tia Maria or brandy</li>
      <li>4 large eggs, separated</li>
      <li>100g golden caster sugar</li>
      <li>300ml pot double cream</li>
      <li>100g/4oz pack honeycomb Toblerone, finely chopped</li>
      <li>Dark chocolate curls, to decorate</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Oil and line a 1-litre loaf tin with cling film. Put the coffee, Tia
        Maria or brandy, egg yolks and sugar in a bowl and stir to dissolve the
        coffee. Put the egg whites in a large bowl and pour the cream in
        another.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat the egg whites until stiff with an electric whisk, then quickly
        beat the egg yolk mixture until thick and leaving a trail. Now beat the
        cream until it holds its shape. If you beat everything in this order,
        you don't need to wash the whisks in between.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold the cream into the coffee mixture, then carefully fold in the
        whites. Fold through the Toblerone and tip into the loaf tin. Lightly
        cover the surface with cling film. When frozen, overwrap in foil and
        freeze. Will keep for up to 6 weeks. You can make the chocolate curls
        (see video link, above, for instructions) and keep them in a airtight
        container or freeze.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, unwrap and turn onto a platter. Strip off the cling film and
        serve topped with the chocolate curls.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Variation: Orange semifreddo</h2>
    <p>
      Omit the coffee and Tia Maria and replace with the zest Â½ orange and an
      orange liqueur like Grand Marnier. Use dark chocolate instead of
      Toblerone.
