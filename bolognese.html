    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      1 1/2 tbsp olive oil <br />
      2 garlic cloves , minced <br />
      1 onion , finely chopped (brown, yellow or white) <br />
      1 lb / 500g beef mince (ground beef) OR half pork, half beef (Note 1)
      <br />
      1/2 cup (125 ml) dry red wine (sub water or beef broth/stock) <br />
      2 beef bouillon cubes , crumbled OR granulated beef bouillon (Note 2)
      <br />
      800g / 28 oz can crushed tomato (or tomato passata) <br />
      2 tbsp tomato paste <br />
      2 tsp white sugar , if needed (Note 3) <br />
      2 tsp Worcestershire sauce <br />
      2 dried bay leaves <br />
      2 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1/2 tsp dried thyme or oregano) <br />
      Salt and pepper
    </p>
    <h2>Cooking Time</h2>
    <p>40 mins</p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion
      and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened. <br />
      Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until
      browned. <br />
      Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom
      of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone. <br />
      Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer
      then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 – 30 minutes
      (no lid), adding water if the <br />
      sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally. <br />
      Slow simmer option: really takes this to another level, if you have the
      time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 –
      2.5 hours, stirring every 30 <br />
      minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce. (Note
      6 for slow cooker) <br />
      Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti –
      though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per
      steps below.
