    <h1>How to Make Vanilla Ice Cream</h1>
    <p>
      Vanilla is the king of ice cream flavors. This version without eggs
      ('American' or 'Philadelphia-style') has a brighter, more pronounced
      vanilla flavor.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>CREAMY BROTH</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>2 ¼ cups milk</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
      Stir sugar, cream, and milk into a saucepan over low heat until sugar has
      dissolved. Heat just until mix is hot and a small ring of foam appears
      around the edge.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
      Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large measuring
      cup. Stir in vanilla extract and chill mix thoroughly, at least 2 hours.
      (Overnight is best.)
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine, and
      churn according to manufacturer's directions, 20 to 25 minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
      When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or place a piece of
      plastic wrap directly on the ice cream and place in freezer to ripen, 2 to
      3 hours.
