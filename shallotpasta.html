      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <h4>       <p>Serves two</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Â¼ cup olive oil 6 large shallots</li>
          <li>very thinly sliced 5 garlic cloves</li>
          <li>4 thinly sliced</li>
          <li>1 finely chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black</li>
          <li>pepper</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste 1</li>
          <li>(2-ounce) can anchovy fillets (about 12)</li>
          <li>
            drained 1 (4.5-ounce) tube or (6-ounce) can of tomato paste (about
            1/2 to 3/4 cup)
          </li>
          <li>
            10 ounces pasta 1 cup parsley, leaves and tender stems, finely
            chopped
          </li>
          <li>Flaky sea salt</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Preparation</h3>
      <h5><p>Preparation time: 40 minutes</p></h5>
      <h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium
            high. Add shallots and thinly sliced garlic, and season with salt
            and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallots have
            become totally softened and caramelized with golden-brown fried
            edges, 15 to 20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add red-pepper flakes and anchovies. (No need to chop the anchovies;
            they will dissolve on their own.) Stir to melt the anchovies into
            the shallots, about 2 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add tomato paste and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring
            constantly to prevent any scorching, until the tomato paste has
            started to cook in the oil a bit, caramelizing at the edges and
            going from bright red to a deeper brick red color, about 2 minutes.
            Remove from heat and transfer about half the mixture to a resealable
            container, leaving the rest behind. (These are your leftovers to be
            used elsewhere: in another batch of pasta or smeared onto roasted
            vegetables, spooned over fried eggs or spread underneath crispy
            chicken thighs.)
          </li>
          <li>
            To serve, cook pasta according to package instructions in a large
            pot of salted boiling water until very al dente (perhaps more al
            dente than usual). Transfer to Dutch oven with remaining shallot
            mixture (or a skillet if you are using the leftover portion) and 1
            cup pasta water. Cook over medium-high heat, swirling the skillet to
            coat each piece of pasta, using a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape
            up any bits on the bottom, until pasta is thick and sauce has
            reduced and is sticky, but not saucy, 3 to 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a small bowl, combine parsley and finely chopped garlic clove,
            and season with flaky salt and pepper. Divide pasta among bowls, or
            transfer to one large serving bowl, and top with parsley mixture and
            a bit more red-pepper flakes, if you like.
          </li>
        </ol>
