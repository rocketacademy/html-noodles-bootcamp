    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 small garlic cloves (6g)</li>
      <li>2 to 3 fresh Thai chiles (2 to 3g total), stemmed (see note)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon (8g) dried shrimp (see note)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons (30g) roasted unsalted peanuts, divided</li>
      <li>
        1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons (35g) palm sugar, softened (see note)
      </li>
      <li>4 cherry tomatoes (about 2 ounces; 60g), halved</li>
      <li>
        2 long beans (about 30g), ends trimmed, cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces
      </li>
      <li>3 tablespoons (45ml) fresh lime juice from 2 limes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) fish sauce</li>
      <li>2 cups (6 ounces; 170g) shredded papaya</li>
      <li>Cooked Rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a clay or wooden mortar, combine garlic and chiles and pound with
        wooden pestle until slightly slightly broken down, making sure to keep
        the pestle as close to the chiles as possible to avoid splattering chile
        juices over yourself, about 30 seconds. Add dried shrimp and 1
        tablespoon (15g) peanuts and continue to pound until slightly broken
        down, taking care not to over-pound and form a peanut paste, about 30
        seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add palm sugar and continue to pound lightly while also working the
        pestle in a circular motion while applying gentle pressure to help
        dissolve the palm sugar, about 30 seconds. Add long beans and pound
        until slightly broken down, 15 to 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and pound
        gently just until the tomatoes release their juices, about 15 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add lime juice and fish sauce and stir with pestle using a circular
        motion until well combined and palm sugar is fully dissolved, about 15
        seconds. Add green papaya. Holding a large spoon in your non-dominant
        hand while holding the pestle in your dominant hand, pound down the
        sides of the mortar (not the center) while simultaneously using the
        spoon to move the ingredients back and forth in the mortar until
        ingredients are well combined and green papaya has begun to absorb the
        dressing, about 30 seconds. Take care not to over-pound the green papaya
        or it will lose its crisp texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add remaining 1 tablespoon (15g) peanuts and pound gently just until
        they are slightly broken down. Transfer salad to a serving plate, and
        serve immediately with sticky rice.
      </li>
    </ol>
