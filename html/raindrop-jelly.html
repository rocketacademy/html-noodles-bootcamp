  <h1>Raindrop Cake</h1>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <li>3/4 cup water</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp + 1/16 tsp agar powder</li>
  <h3>Toppings</h3>
  <li>1/2- 1 tbsp roasted soybean flour</li>
  <li>1-2 tbsp black sugar syup</li>

  <h3>Preperation Time - 10 mins</h3>
  <ul></ul>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      In a small saucepan, add agar powder and water and stir with a spatula a
      few times, until the agar powder dissolves into the water.
    </li>
    <li>
      Turn your stovetop to medium heat and bring the agar water mixture to a
      boil. Maintaining a medium heat level, allow mixture to boil
    </li>
    (without a lid) for one minute, then turn off heat. Try to be as accurate
    with the timing as possible. If you don't heat long enough, your agar won't
    be fully dissolved. If you cook too long, your mixture will condense down
    too much. Use a spatula to stir the mixture a few times. Pour mixture into
    molds. You should have enough to fill exactly two cavities if you are using
    the silicone molds I used.

    <li>
      Place molds into the fridge to set. I recommend letting them set
      overnight, or at least 10 hours. When they are ready, they should
    </li>
    easily slide out just by you slightly tilting the molds. Do not take the
    cakes out of the fridge until you are ready to serve because they will start
    to melt after 20-30 minutes. Add your cakes to a plate. Add some soybean
    flour to your plate and drizzle black sugar syrup on top of the cake or on
    the side.
