      <h3>Ingredients for one servings</h3>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>0.5 teaspoon of salt</li>
      <li>0.5 teaspoon ground black peper</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>0.5 cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
      <br />
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
        <li>
          To make the prawn stock, add cooking oil to a large saucepan on
          medium-high heat. Add prawn heads and shells then stir for 5 minutes,
          crushing the heads to release the flavour.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>
          Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork
          until well blended.
        </li>
        <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
        <li>
          Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes
          per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted
          into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
