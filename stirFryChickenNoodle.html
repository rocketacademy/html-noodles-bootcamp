    <h3><strong>Instructions </strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <p>
        Step 1: Rinse the fresh egg noodles with cold water, drain the excess
        water and set aside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 2: In a small mixing bowl, marinate the chicken with all the all
        the seasonings in the Marinade, for 15 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 3: Heat up a wok with 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil. When the wok
        is heated, add the chicken into the wok and pan-fry the chicken until
        slightly charred and blackened on both sides. Remove the chicken from
        the wok and into a bowl. Set aside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 4: Clean the wok and heat it up with the remaining 2 tablespoons of
        oil. Add in the minced garlic and stir-fry until light brown or
        aromatic. Add the shredded cabbage and carrot into the wok and do a few
        quick stirs. Stir in the noodles, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and water.
        Continue to stir fry until the noodles are well blended with the
        seasonings and completely cooked through. Dish out and transfer into two
        serving bowls. Top the chicken noodles with the chicken (and its juice),
        garnish with the sesame seeds and scallion. Serve immediately.
