               <li>Wipe out the pan with kitchen paper, then add about 2 tbsp oil, onions, carrots, and garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 mins over low-medium heat.Stir in the tomato pur√©e and cook for a further 3 mins. Add the wine, herbs, tomatoes and stock, season and bring to the boil, stir the beef back into the sauce and reduce to a simmer. Cover and put in the oven for 2 hrs 30 mins, then remove the lid, stir and put back in the oven, uncovered, for 30 mins. Stir or use a fork to roughly shred the beef, and season.

            <li>When ready to serve, gently reheat the ragout over a medium heat. Cook the pasta in a large pan of salted water for 3 mins, drain then tip into the ragout, toss together with some of the parmesan and leave for 1 min.
