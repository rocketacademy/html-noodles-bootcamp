    <h2>Preparation time:</h2>
    <p>2 hours</p>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sweet potato noodles</li>
      <li>Onion</li>
      <li>Carrot</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>spinach</li>
      <li>Shiitake mushrooms</li>
      <li>Beef/Pork</li>
      <li>Soy sauce</li>
      <li>Gralic</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Sweet rice Wine</li>
      <li>Oils</li>
      <li>Sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>METHOD</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak the noodles in hot water for 15 minutes, then drain and set aside.
        Pre-soaking will soften the noodles and make them easier to cook.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice beef (or pork) into thin match sticks and season with soy sauce,
        sugar, and rice wine; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine all the japchae sauce ingredients, and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet or wok over medium high heat.
        Add onion, carrot, pepper, and a pinch of salt; stir-fry until soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sliced shiitake mushrooms and another pinch of salt. Continue to
        stir-fry until they become soft. Stir-fry the spinach until it wilts,
        and add it at the end.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the vegetables to a large
        plate to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reheat the pan over high heat with 1 tablespoon of oil, then add the
        beef (or pork) and stir-fry until fully cooked. You will see the juice
        coming out from the meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the meat to the large plate with the reserved vegetables,
        reserving the juice in the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the noodles from soaking and add them to the pan with the meat
        juices.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the japchae sauce over the noodles and toss to combine.</li>
      <li>
        Allow the noodles to cook over medium heat until they become soft and
        absorb most of the liquid from the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to low. Add the vegetables and meat back to the pan over
        the noodles.
      </li>
      <li>Add sesame seeds and toss all together to incorporate.</li>
      <li>
        Drizzle more sesame oil if you wish. Taste and season more according to
        your taste.
      </li>
