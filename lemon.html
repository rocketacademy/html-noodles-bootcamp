    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Lemon Loaf</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream or Greek yogurt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup canola or vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 to 2 tablespoons lemon extract, to taste</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Lemon Glaze</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup confectioners’ sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice, or as necessary for consistency</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation Time</h3>
    <p>1 hr 30 mins</p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Loaf</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350F. Spray a 9×5-inch loaf pan with floured cooking
        spray, or grease and flour the pan; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        To a large bowl, add the eggs, sugar, sour cream, and whisk vigorously
        until smooth and combined.
      </li>
      <li>Drizzle in the oil while whisking to combine.</li>
      <li>
        Add the lemon zest, lemon extract, and whisk to combine. Note – I used 2
        tablespoons of lemon extract because no actual lemon juice is used in
        the loaf and I found 2 tablespoons lemon extract necessary for
        full-bodied lemon flavor, but add to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the flour, baking powder, salt, and stir until just combined, don’t
        overmix. Some lumps will be present and that’s okay, don’t try to stir
        them smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the batter out into prepared pan, smoothing the top lightly with a
        spatula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for about 50 to 52 minutes, or until top is domed, set, and
        toothpick inserted in the center crack comes out clean or with a few
        moist crumbs but no batter. In the last 10 minutes of baking, tent pan
        with foil (loosely drape a sheet of foil over pan) to prevent excessive
        browning on the top and sides of bread before center cooks through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow loaf to cool in pan on top of a wire rack for at least 30 minutes
        (I cooled 4 hours) before turning out onto rack to cool completely
        before glazing.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Lemon Glaze</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To a small bowl, add the confectioner’s sugar and slowly drizzle in the
        lemon juice while whisking until smooth and combined. You may need to
        play with the sugar and lemon juice amounts a bit as necessary for
        desired consistency and flavor.
      </li>
      <li>Evenly drizzle glaze over bread before slicing and serving.</li>
      <li>
        Extra glaze can be spread on the cut surface of the bread like you’d
        spread butter on toast and it soaks right in making the bread even
        moister and more lemony. Or you can halve the glaze recipe if you’re not
        a glaze person.
