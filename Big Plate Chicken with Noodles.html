      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Start by marinating the chicken. Cut the chicken thighs into
          bite-sized pieces and transfer to a bowl with the marinade
          ingredients. Set aside for 20 minutes while you prep the rest of the
          ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you're ready to cook, heat the oil in a wok over low heat. Add
          the star anise, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, ginger, garlic, Sichuan
          peppercorns, chilies, and sugar. Cook this mixture for 2 minutes,
          making sure they don’t burn. Add the chicken and turn up the heat.
          Stir-fry until the chicken is seared.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the potatoes and carrots and stir-fry for a minute. Then add the
          dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, shaoxing wine, and 3 cups water.
          Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to medium. Cover the wok and cook
          for 15 minutes, until the potatoes are tender.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the chicken is cooking, bring a pot of water to a boil. Follow
          the package instructions to cook the noodles. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the potatoes are cooked through, by now, there should be at least
          1 1 1/2 cups of liquid in the wok so add more water if needed.To your
          wok, stir in the bell peppers. Cover and simmer for another 5 minutes.
          Taste the dish and season with salt to taste. Now transfer the noodles
          to a large plate, and cover with your chicken and vegetables. Sprinkle
          with scallions and serve immediately!
        </li>
        <li>
          Note: If you want more sauce, add a little more water to the wok. If
          the sauce is too thin, just turn up the heat to reduce and thicken the
          sauce.
