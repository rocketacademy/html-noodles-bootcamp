    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 3/4 pounds yellow onions</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons salted butter, at room temperature, divided</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>8 ounces long pasta, such as fettuccine or pappardelle</li>
      <li>1 to 2 garnishes (optional, see Author Notes)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Total preparation time: 50 minutes</h3>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Halve, peel, and thinly slice the onions. Mince just enough sliced onion
        to yield 2 tablespoons, then set that aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 2 tablespoons of butter to a large skillet over medium heat. Once
        melted, add the sliced onions. Generously season with salt and pepper.
        Cook until golden and jammy, 25 to 35 minutes, stirring often and
        lowering the heat as needed to avoid scorching; you can add a splash of
        water every so often if needed to deglaze if the onions threaten to
        burn. When they’re done, drop the heat to as low as possible to keep
        warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, fill a large pot with water and set over high heat to come to
        a boil. When the water is boiling, generously season with salt, then add
        the pasta. Cook according to the package instructions until al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        With the skillet still over low heat, use tongs or a slotted spoon to
        transfer the pasta to the skillet with the onions (and don’t drain that
        water). Add the minced onion, remaining 4 tablespoons of butter, and ¼
        cup of pasta water, then toss everything together. Add more pasta water
        if needed to reach a sauce consistency you love, keeping in mind that
        it’ll thicken as it sits. Toss in or sprinkle with a bonus or two, if
        you’d like.
      </li>
    </ol>
