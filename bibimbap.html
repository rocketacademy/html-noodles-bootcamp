    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p><strong>RICE</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        3/4 cup short-grain brown or white rice, rinsed (soaking for 12-24 hours
        to speed cooking is optional*)
      </li>
      <li>
        1 ½ cups water (if rice was soaked, reduce water by about 1/4 cup (60
        ml) as recipe is written)
      </li>
      <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>VEGGIES + EGG</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2-3 Tbsp sesame oil, DIVIDED (toasted for more flavor, untoasted works,
        too*)
      </li>
      <li>
        3 cups packed mixed vegetables (such as finely shredded carrot, thinly
        sliced zucchini, or spinach)
      </li>
      <li>1 heaping cup bean sprouts</li>
      <li>2 stalks green onion, sliced on an angle</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>
        2 Tbsp coconut aminos, DIVIDED (or sub tamari to taste, or sea salt)
      </li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>FOR SERVING</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>2-4 Tbsp Gochujang Sauce</li>
      <li>Kimchi (optional)</li>
      <li>Toasted or raw sesame seeds (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Optional: If soaking rice, rinse, drain, and add to a mixing bowl and
        cover with cool water. Soak for 12 hours or overnight. For a quicker
        soak, cover in hot water for 1 hour. Then rinse and drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        To a medium saucepan, add cooking water (if you soaked your rice, start
        with 1 ¼ cups water as recipe is written), rinsed rice, and salt. Heat
        over high heat and bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and cover.
        Cook for 15-20 minutes or until water is absorbed and rice is tender and
        fluffy. Soaked rice generally takes less time to cook. Unsoaked rice can
        take up to 30 minutes or more. Keep covered and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>In the meantime, prepare Gochujang sauce.</li>
      <li>
        While the rice finishes cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat
        (stainless steel or cast iron are best). Once hot, add 1 tsp of sesame
        oil or enough to just coat the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the oil is hot, add vegetables one type at a time and cook in
        batches until lightly browned (1-2 minutes), seasoning each with a
        little minced garlic and a dash of coconut aminos, tamari, or sea salt.
        Cooking in batches allows you to arrange vegetables separately over the
        rice for visual effect. We cooked the zucchini first, then carrots,
        green onion, bean sprouts, and spinach. Add more oil to the pan as
        needed between vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange cooked vegetables in individual piles on a serving plate and
        cover gently to keep warm until serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        To cook eggs, heat the same pan over medium heat. Once hot, add a little
        more oil (sesame or otherwise), and carefully crack eggs. For sunny-side
        up, cover briefly with a lid to steam for 1 minute, then remove lid and
        continue cooking until whites are cooked but yolks are still runny. Turn
        off heat and set aside (uncovered).
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, divide desired amount of rice between serving bowls (see notes
        for traditional dolsot recommendations and crispy rice hacks!) and top
        with portions of cooked veggies and egg.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve with 1-2 Tbsp Gochujang, kimchi (optional), and a dash of sesame
        seeds (optional). Bibimbap means “mixed rice,” so once your egg and
        Gochujang sauce are added, use a spoon or your chopsticks to stir
        everything together and mix the flavors. Then enjoy!
      </li>
      <li>
        This dish is best fresh, but leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator
        up to 2 days and be reheated on the stovetop over medium heat as a stir
        fry. Not freezer-friendly.
      </li>
