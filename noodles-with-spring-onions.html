      <li>1 3" piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>½ cup vegetable or sunflower oil</li>
      <li>½ serrano or other green chile, thinly sliced (with seeds)</li>
      <li>
        ¼ cup finely chopped tender herbs (such as cilantro, mint, and/or basil)
      </li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. low-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp. toasted sesame seeds</li>
      <li>1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>½ tsp. kosher salt</li>
      <li>½ tsp. sugar</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Instructions</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place half of spring onions in a large heatproof bowl and set a
        fine-mesh sieve on top; set aside. Combine remaining spring onions with
        ginger, garlic, and oil in a small saucepan. Set over medium-high and
        cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is golden and scallions are
        beginning to crisp and turn golden brown, 8–10 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Pour mixture through reserved sieve onto spring onions. Turn out garlic
        crisp in sieve onto paper towels to drain. Stir spring onions in bowl
        until just softened, about 1 minute. Stir in chile, herbs, soy sauce,
        vinegar, sesame seeds, pepper, salt, and sugar. Let dressing sit 10
        minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Meanwhile, cook noodles according to package directions. Drain and rinse
        under warm water to get rid of any excess starch.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Transfer the chicken pieces to a baking tray lined with foil. Place the
        chicken under the grill for 10 minutes or until golden. Slice the
        chicken.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Transfer noodles to bowl with dressing and add butter and half of garlic
        crisp; toss to coat noodles. Divide among bowls; top with remaining
        garlic crisp.
      </li>
      <br />
    </ol>
