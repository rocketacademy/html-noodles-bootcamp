      <h4>Berry Glaze (Optional)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup (53g) light brown sugar or dark brown sugar, packed</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (170g) juice (apple, cranberry, etc.)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin</li>
        <li>2 pints (454g) fresh berries, washed</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><b>To make the crust:</b> In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, lemon zest or oil, and salt.</li>
        <li>Using a pastry fork or pastry blender, your fingers, or an electric mixer, cut in the cold butter, working the mixture until it's crumbly; a few larger chunks of butter can remain.</li>
        <li>In a small cup or bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and the vanilla. Stir this mixture into the pastry dough.</li>
        <li>Roll or press the dough onto the bottom and at least 1" up the sides of a 9" to 10" springform pan or tart pan (preferably with a removable bottom), or 9" round cake pan.</li>
        <li>Use a fork to prick the dough all over (this will keep it from puffing up as it bakes), and refrigerate it for 30 minutes or longer.</li>
        <li>Bake the chilled crust for 16 to 18 minutes in a preheated 375°F oven, until it's golden brown. Check it midway through the baking time; if it's developed any big bubbles, puncture them.</li>
        <li>Remove the crust from the oven (leave the oven on), and cool it on a rack as you prepare the filling.</li><br>
        <li><b>To make the lemon filling:</b> In a medium-sized bowl, or the bowl of an electric mixer, mix together the sour cream and sugar.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the eggs, then add the lemon juice and lemon zest or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour the filling into the cooled tart shell. Don't overfill the shell; if any filling seeps over the top edge, it'll burn and stick.</li>
        <li>Return the tart to the 375°F oven, and bake it for 18 to 20 minutes. The filling should look "set," but still wobble slightly in the middle.</li>
        <li>Remove the tart from the oven, and set it on a rack to cool for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate the tart; top it with berries and glaze a few hours before serving.</li><br>
        <li><b>To make the berry glaze (if using):</b> In a saucepan or microwave-safe bowl, combine the brown sugar and juice.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the gelatin over the juice, and let it swell and soften for 5 minutes or so.</li>
        <li>Heat the mixture over low heat or in the microwave until the gelatin dissolves.</li>
        <li>Remove it from the heat and let it cool for about 30 minutes, until it's lukewarm.</li><br>
        <li><b>To assemble:</b> If you're using strawberries, wash, trim the top of the strawberries to remove their leaves, and slice them; you can leave them whole if they're small.</li>
        <li>Brush a thin layer of glaze (about 2 tablespoons) over the tart.</li>
        <li>Mix the berries with the remaining glaze, then arrange them, one by one, atop the tart. You'll have some glaze left in the bottom of the bowl; pour it into a small container and keep it at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Place the tart in the refrigerator for the glaze to set.</li>
        <li>After about 30 minutes of chilling, remove the tart from the fridge, and brush the berries with the reserved glaze. This will keep them fresh and glistening for 12 hours.</li><br>
        <li><b>Storage information:</b>Store, covered, in the fridge for 3 days.</li>
      </ol>
