    <h1>Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fish head</li>
        <li>1 small green papaya</li>
        <li>4 dried red dates</li>
        <li>60g ginger</li>
        <li>1 tsp wolfberry seeds</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>5 cups water</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Wash the fish clean. If using a fish head, make sure that the cavity is thoroughly cleaned. Chop/cut into big pieces (I get the fishmonger to cut the fish head). Pat dry with paper towels and rub some salt on all sides of the fish. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring water to boil in a soup pot.</li>
        <li>While waiting for the water to boil, peel the papaya with a vegetable peeler. Remove all the seeds and cut it into bite-sized chunks.</li>
        <li>Heat up sesame oil in a separate frying pan/pot. Fry half of the ginger for about a minute before adding the fish to fry. Brown the fish on both sides until it is completely cooked.</li>
        <li>When the water starts to boil, put in the red dates, fried fish, green papaya chunks and the rest of the ginger into a claypot or any suitable soup pot. Avoid stirring the soup to prevent the fish from breaking. Let it simmer for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season with salt if necessary. Optional: Pour â…› tsp of sesame oil into the soup if desired. Serve hot.</li>
      </ol>
