    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      6 oz. pasta (such as egg tagliolini, bucatini, or spaghetti)
      <br />
      3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cubed, divided <br />
      1 tsp. freshly cracked black pepper <br />
      ¾ cup finely grated Grana Padano or Parmesan <br />
      ⅓ cup finely grated Pecorino
    </p>
    <h2>Cooking Time</h2>
    <p>15 mins</p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      1. Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a 5-qt. pot. Season with salt; add
      pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until about 2 minutes before
      tender. Drain, reserving ¾ cup pasta cooking water. <br />
      2. Meanwhile, melt 2 Tbsp. butter in a Dutch oven or other large pot or
      skillet over medium heat. Add pepper and cook, swirling pan, until
      toasted, about 1 minute. <br />
      3. Add ½ cup reserved pasta water to skillet and bring to a simmer. Add
      pasta and remaining butter. Reduce heat to low and add Grana Padano,
      stirring and tossing with tongs until melted. Remove pan from heat; add
      Pecorino, stirring and tossing until cheese melts, sauce coats the pasta,
      and pasta is al dente. (Add more pasta water if sauce seems dry.) Transfer
      pasta to warm bowls and serve.
