                        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                        <h4>To cook congee</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Add the rice, chicken broth, ginger, green onion and salt into your Instant Pot. Cover and seal the lid. Select high pressure, and set the timer to 25 minutes. If you’re using a pressure cooker, seal the lid and cook over medium heat until pressure is reached. Then reduce to low heat and cook for 25 minutes. Once done, let the pressure release naturally.</li>
                            <li>Once the pressure has fully released, open the lid and stir the congee with a ladle. It might look thin once it’s done cooking, but it will thicken up a bit once you stir it well and let it sit for a few minutes. If you want to change the texture of the congee, turn on the “Saute” function and let it boil down for a few minutes and stir constantly, until it turns thicker. Or you can pour in a bit of hot water and stir it if you want to thin it out.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>To prepare toppings</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Make the toppings while the congee is cooking. Add the bacon to a nonstick skillet and cook over medium heat. Cook, flipping occasionally, until the bacon has turned golden brown and crispy. If it starts to smoke too much, turn to medium-low heat. Once done, set aside to let cool slightly. Then cut or crumble the bacon into small pieces.</li>
                            <li>You can use the bacon fat to cook the eggs if you prefer. If not, wipe the pan clean with a paper towel and add the oil. Heat over medium heat until oil is hot. Add the eggs. Let cook, using your spatula to arrange the egg whites so they form rounded shapes. Cook the eggs until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny. Or you can also cook the eggs until your desired doneness.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>To assemble congee:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Spoon the congee into individual serving bowls. For each bowl, top with the egg, drizzle with 1 teaspoon soy sauce, sprinkle with bacon crumbles and green onions (if desired), and finish up with homemade chili oil. Enjoy it while it’s hot!</li>
                        </ol>
