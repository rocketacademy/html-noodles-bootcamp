      <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          Place ham into a roasting pan. Spread Dijon mustard over top and sides
          of ham in an even coat; sprinkle ham with brown sugar. Press brown
          sugar onto ham with your hands. Place pineapple slices onto ham,
          securing them to the top and sides with cloves. Place any unused
          pineapple slices into the bottom of the roasting pan and pour
          pineapple juice and 2 ounces orange-flavored rum.<img

          />
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until ham is heated through and brown sugar
          has begun to glaze onto the meat, about 1 hour. Remove ham from the
          oven and pour remaining 2 ounces of orange rum over the ham; carefully
          light the rum on fire with a match. The flames will help the glaze to
          adhere to the meat.<br />

        </li>
        <li>
          Continue baking until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into
          the thickest part of the ham, not touching bone, reads at least 140
          degrees F (60 degrees C), about 1 more hour. Let ham rest for 10
          minutes before serving. Transfer ham to a serving platter, leaving pan
          drippings in the roasting pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until smooth; whisk
          cornstarch into pan drippings. Place roasting pan over medium-low heat
          and whisk until pan juices thicken, about 5 minutes. Serve with ham.

      <h1>Frequestly Asked Questions</h1>
      <p><b>Q: Can I use an air-fryer to cook the ham? </b></p>
      <p>
        A: An air-fryer is simply too small for the ham to fit, consider using a
        baking oven.
      </p>
      <p><b>Q: Do you use bee or hornet honey? </b></p>
      <p>
        A: Hornet honey tastes better, but can be substituted with wasp or bee
        honey.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: Can I substitute other forms of alcohol? Eg. Riot Punch? </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes you can, but grain based alcohols like Riot Punch might not go
        with the flavour of the ham. Try using a darker spirit like whiskey or
        brandy as a substitute.
