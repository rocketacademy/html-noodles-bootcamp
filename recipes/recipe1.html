    <p>
      Seared Salmon Nigiri (Aburi Salmon) is one of the most popular nigiri
      sushi items at sushi train restaurants. The one with a sweet soy-based
      sauce brushed over the seared salmon is particularly popular. By searing
      it, the salmon becomes sweeter and more delicious. The faint aroma of
      charred flesh is also appetising.

        sushi.

        sauce, mirin and sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tezu (手酢) – mixture of rice wine vinegar and water, used to wet your
        hands before handling the sushi rice.

      Preparation
      <ol>
        <li>
          Put all the Tare ingredients in a small saucepan and bring it to a
          boil. Bring the heat down and simmer gently until the liquid reduces
          to about half of the original quantity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Put the Sushi Rice Vinegar ingredients in a bowl and mix well until
          the sugar is dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sprinkle the Sushi Rice Vinegar over the hot rice in a bowl and mix
          using a spatula. Move the spatula in a cutting motion so that you
          don’t break the rice grains. Cover the bowl with a wet kitchen
          towel/kitchen paper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slice the salmon fillets into 3-5mm / ⅛-3⁄16" thick pieces using the
          sogi-giri (slant cutting) method.

      <ol>
        <li>Wet both palms with the tezu, massage hands ensuring that all fingers including between the fingers are wet (note 5). Then clap your hands once so that the excess liquid will be splashed and eliminated.</li>
        <li>Take 1/12 of the rice (about 15g / 0.5oz) in your right hand and squeeze the rice gently to make a ball (about 3-3.5cm / 1¼-1⅜" in diameter).</li>
        <li>Place a salmon piece across the proximal phalanx (base section of the fingers) of your left hand (for the right hander).Place the rice ball on the centre of the salmon piece, then make a dent in the centre of the rice with your right index finger (to air the rice).</li>
        <li>Turn the sushi over by rolling it towards the tips of your fingers and move it to where the salmon piece was placed initially.</li>
        <li>With your right thumb and the index finger, hold the sides of the sushi including the edge of the salmon piece, and squeeze very gently (to shape and wrap the sushi with the salmon).</li>
      </ol>
