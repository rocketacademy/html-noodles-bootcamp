					<li>If using water spinach/kangkung and bean sprouts, bring a medium pan of water to a boil, cook the bean sprouts briefly about 30 seconds in boiling water. Then blanch water spinach briefly for about 1-2 minutes. Turn off the heat, drain and run them under cold water. Set aside</li>
					<li>Prepare the noodles by bringing a large pot of water to a boil, depending on which type of noodles you use, follow the instruction on cooking the noodles. Set aside.</li>
					<li>Turn on "saute" on instant pot. Add 3 Tbsp of oil and saute the garlic for about 30 seconds. Add prawn heads, shell, and tails and saute until they are fragrant and the color changes to orange</li>
					<li>Add pork ribs, star anise, cloves, white peppercorns, water, and seasonings. Close the lid. Press "pressure cooker" and make sure it's on "High Pressure" and set the timer for 15 minutes. If you leave the ribs whole, pressure cook for 30 minutes. When the timer is done, wait 10 minutes and then turn steam release handle to venting. Wait until the pressure valve goes all the way down and then open the lid.</li>
