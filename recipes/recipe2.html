      <p>
        The typical egg dish in Japanese cuisine, dashimaki tamago (出し巻き卵,
        Japanese rolled omelette) is made by rolling thin layers of egg in the
        frypan. The beautiful layers of the egg when sliced, and the sweet dashi
        flavour make this omelette so unique.

      <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Gently beat eggs in a bowl or a large measuring cup, trying to cut the
          egg white into small chunks but do not beat hard
        </li>
        <li>
          Add all the ingredients except oil into the bowl/measuring cup and mix
          until sugar is dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place a non-stick frypan (note 4) or a tamagoyaki pan over medium low
          to medium heat and oil using the oil-soaked paper towel as if you are
          wiping the pan so that the amount of oil is not excessive.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the frypan and oil is heated up (note 5), pour about 1/5 of the
          egg mixture into the pan. The egg should start cooking straight away
          and you should see some bubbles lifting the surface of the egg.
        </li>
        <li>
          Poke the large bubbles to flatten using chopsticks or the edge of a
          spatula.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the surface of the egg starts drying but is still half wet, fold
          the both sides of the egg sheet inwards using a spatula so that the
          sides are straight instead of round (frypan only). Use a spatula to
          roll the egg starting from the furthest end from you. Place the
          spatula underneath the egg about 1.5cm (½”) into the egg, then lift
          and flip towards you. It will fold with about 1.5cm (½”) width.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat to roll the rest using the first fold as the core of the roll
          until the egg roll shifts to the end of the frypan closest to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lightly oil the farthest end part of the frypan using the oiled paper
          towel. Slide the egg to the farthest end of the frypan and oil the
          rest of the frypan lightly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour 1/5 of the original egg mixture amount to the frypan. Do not pour
          the egg mixture over the cooked egg roll but lift the egg roll
          slightly so that the new egg mixture goes underneath it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat steps 5 to 9 until the egg mixture is used up, ending with step
          8.
        </li>
        <li>
          Squeeze excess water out of grated daikon, add it next to the egg
          slices and serve.
        </li>
      </ol>
