    <p>Ingredients</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Spaghetti: 400 grams (about 14 ounces)</li>
      <li>Pancetta or guanciale (Italian cured pork cheek): 150 grams, diced</li>
      <li>Large eggs: 3</li>
      <li>Freshly grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese: 1 cup</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper: 1 teaspoon (or to taste)</li>
      <li>Salt: for the pasta water</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Instructions</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook the Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente (usually about 8-10 minutes, but refer to the package instructions). Reserve about a cup of pasta water before draining the pasta.</li>
      <li>Prepare the Egg and Cheese Mixture: While the pasta is cooking, in a mixing bowl, beat the eggs and then mix in the grated cheese and black pepper. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Cook the Pancetta/Guanciale: In a large skillet, cook the diced pancetta or guanciale over medium heat until it's crispy and the fat has rendered. Remove from heat.</li>
      <li>Combine Pasta and Pancetta/Guanciale: Drain the pasta and add it immediately to the skillet with the pancetta/guanciale. Toss to coat the pasta in the fat. Remove the skillet from the heat to prevent the eggs from scrambling in the next step.</li>
      <li>Add the Egg and Cheese Mixture: Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, and quickly toss or stir the pasta to coat it in the sauce. The heat from the pasta will gently cook the eggs and melt the cheese, creating a creamy sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water to reach the desired consistency.</li>
      <li>Season and Serve: Season with additional black pepper if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
