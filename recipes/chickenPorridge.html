      <li>Rinse the Rice: Wash the rice in cold water until the water runs clear. This step removes excess starch and prevents the porridge from becoming too thick.</li>
      <li>Cook the Chicken: In a pot, add the chicken breasts, ginger slices, and 6 cups of chicken broth or water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer. Cook the chicken for about 20 minutes or until fully cooked. Remove the chicken, shred it into pieces, and set aside. Keep the broth.</li>
      <li>Cook the Porridge: In the same pot with the broth, add the rinsed rice. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cook for about 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. If the porridge is too thick, you can add more water or broth to reach your desired consistency.</li>
      <li>Season the Porridge: Once the rice is soft and the porridge has a creamy texture, add salt to taste.</li>
      <li>Serve: Ladle the porridge into bowls, top with shredded chicken, and add your desired toppings like green onions, soy sauce, sesame oil, fried garlic, boiled eggs, cilantro, or pepper.</li>
      <li>Green onions, a few stalks (chopped)</li>
      <li>Enjoy: Serve hot and enjoy your comforting bowl of chicken porridge!</li>
    </ol>
