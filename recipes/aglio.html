    <p>Instructions</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Boil Pasta: Start by boiling a large pot of salted water. Once boiling, add the spaghetti and cook until al dente (usually about 8-10 minutes, but check the package instructions). Reserve about a cup of the pasta water before draining.</li>
      <li>Prepare Garlic and Oil: While the pasta is cooking, thinly slice the garlic. Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook until the garlic is just golden, not browned (this should take about 2-3 minutes).</li>
      <li>Combine Pasta and Garlic Oil: Drain the pasta and add it directly to the pan with the garlic oil. Toss well to coat the pasta in the garlic oil. If the pasta seems dry, add a little of the reserved pasta water to help emulsify the sauce.</li>
      <li>Season and Serve: Add the chopped parsley, and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Toss everything together well.</li>
      <li>Optional: Serve with a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
      <li>Enjoy: Your Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is ready to enjoy!</li>
