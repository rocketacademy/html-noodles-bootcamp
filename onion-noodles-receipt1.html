        INSTRUCTIONS<br />
        Cook the spaghetti. Bring a large stockpot of generously-salted water to
        a boil. Add spaghetti and cook until nearly al dente (like, just one
        minute shy of being done).<br />
        Sauté the garlic. Meanwhile, about 3 minutes after you add the pasta to
        the boiling water, heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium
        heat. Add the sliced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes and sauté for
        3 to 5 minutes, or until it is lightly golden. (It’s very important that
        the garlic not burn. So if the pasta is not ready to go by the time the
        garlic is lightly golden, remove the sauté pan from the heat until the
        pasta is ready.)<br />
        Toss the pasta in the sauce. As soon as the pasta is ready to go, use
        tongs to transfer the pasta to the sauté pan, along with 1/2 cup of the
        hot starchy pasta water. Toss the pasta continuously until it is evenly
        coated in the garlic sauce. If the sauce looks a bit too dry, add in
        another 1/4 cup of the starchy pasta water.<br />
        Taste and season. Give the pasta a quick taste add an extra pinch of
        salt and/or crushed red pepper flakes if needed.<br />
        Serve. Serve immediately while it’s nice and hot, garnished with any
        toppings that sound good.
