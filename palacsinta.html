    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>Makes about 12 pieces.</p>

    <h3>For the palacsinta</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>150 grams (1 cup) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>175 ml (¾ cup) whole milk</li>
      <li>175 ml (¾ cup) water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla sugar (or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted (for the batter)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter (for the pan)</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fillings</h3>
    <p>
      Common fillings in Hungary include fruit preserves (apricot, raspberry,
      plum, blueberry), sweetened túró, lemon mixed with powdered sugar,
      cinnamon sugar, and Nutella.
    </p>
    <p>For the sweetened túró, mix together:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>400 grams (2 cups) cottage cheese, mashed with a fork to a paste</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons sour cream</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla sugar (or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract)</li>
      <li>Freshly grated lemon zest and juice using 1 small lemon</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons raisins</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a pan. Then using a blender or a whisk, mix
        together the flour, liquid (milk and water), eggs, sugar, vanilla sugar
        (or extract), melted butter, and salt in a small pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        With half a teaspoon of butter, lightly coat the surface of a
        regular-sized (10-inch) non-stick pan on medium-high. Once butter is
        bubbling, using a ladle, pour a quarter of a cup (about half a ladle) of
        batter onto the hot pan and spread it evenly across the surface so it
        forms a thin layer. Cook the first side until splotches of brown appear,
        about a minute, then flip it over with the help of a wooden spatula or
        fork and do the other side for half a minute. Transfer the palacsinta to
        a plate and cover the pile with another plate so they keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat for the remaining batter. After each palacsinta, re-butter the
        pan with a touch of butter so the batter doesn't stick to the bottom and
        palacsinta gets extra tasty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill the palacsintas as desired, roll them into logs, and sprinkle with
        powdered sugar. Alternatively, serve them unfilled piled on a serving
        plate and let people finish for themselves.
      </li>
    </ol>
