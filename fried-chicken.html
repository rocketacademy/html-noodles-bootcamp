      <ol>
        <li>
          Season the chicken: Rinse the chicken in cold water and pat dry. Place
          the chicken in a Ziploc bag and season liberally with salt and pepper.
          Let chill while making the wash and dredge.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Soak the mushrooms overnight, then cook them for an hour the next day.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Make the wash and dredge: In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and
          hot sauce with 4 cups cold water. Refrigerate until cold, about 30
          minutes. In a large bowl, whisk the flour with the salt, black pepper,
          white pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic, and poultry seasoning. (If
          making the fried chicken livers, reserve about 1½ cups of the dredge.)
          Fill a 12-inch cast-iron skillet with 2 inches oil and heat to 350°F.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Fry the chicken: Remove the wash from the refrigerator and dip the
          chicken in the wash, then press the chicken in the flour mixture and
          shake off the excess. Let the chicken rest on a plate, refrigerated,
          for 10 minutes, then re-press the chicken in the flour dredge. Line a
          platter with a cloth napkin or paper towels and set aside. Working in
          batches, place the chicken in the hot skillet and cook until the
          underside is golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook
          until the other side is golden brown, an additional 7 to 8 minutes
          (some of the smaller pieces, like the legs and wings, will be done
          faster than the breasts or thighs). Place the chicken on the lined
          platter to drain. Season with additional salt, if desired, and serve
          hot or at room temperature.
