      <li>Sea salt</li>
      <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1/3 cup of dark beer, cold</li>

      <br />
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>
          Set aside 2 tablespoons of flour. In a large, roomy bowl, mix the
          remaining flour with the cornstarch and baking powder. Season lightly
          with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using a fork to whisk continuously, add the beer and the sparkling
          water to the flour mixture and continue mixing until you have a thick,
          smooth batter. Place the batter in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes
          to 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into a little less than 1/2-inch-thick
          slices, then slice these into 1/2-inch-wide chips. Place the chips
          into a colander and rinse under cold running water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the washed chips into a pan of cold water. Bring to a gentle
          boil and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain carefully through a colander, then dry with paper towels. Keep
          in the fridge covered with paper towels until needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, lay the fish fillets on a paper towel and pat dry. Season
          lightly with a little sea salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the oil to 350 F in a deep-fat fryer or large, deep saucepan.
          Cook the chips a few handfuls at a time in the oil for about 2
          minutes. Do not brown them. Once the chips are slightly cooked, remove
          them from the oil and drain. Keep to one side
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the 2 tablespoons of flour reserved from the batter mix into a
          shallow bowl. Toss each fish fillet in the flour and shake off any
          excess.
        </li>
        <li>Dip into the batter, coating the entire fillet.</li>
        <li>
          Check that the oil temperature is still 350 F. Carefully lower each
          fillet into the hot oil. Fry for approximately 8 minutes, or until the
          batter is crisp and golden, turning the fillets from time to time with
          a large slotted spoon.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once cooked, remove the fillets from the hot oil and drain on paper
          towels. Sprinkle with salt. Cover with greaseproof paper (parchment
          paper) and keep hot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the oil to 400 F, then cook the chips until golden and crisp, or
          about 5 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain. Season with salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve immediately with the hot fish accompanied by your favorite
          condiment.
        </li>
