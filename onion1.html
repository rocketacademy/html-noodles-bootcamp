        Instructions
        <ol>
          <li>
            Place half of spring onions in a large heatproof bowl and set a
            fine-mesh sieve on top; set aside. Combine remaining spring onions
            with ginger, garlic, and oil in a small saucepan. Set over
            medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is golden
            and scallions are beginning to crisp and turn golden brown, 8â€“10
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour mixture through reserved sieve onto spring onions. Turn out
            garlic crisp in sieve onto paper towels to drain. Stir spring onions
            in bowl until just softened, about 1 minute. Stir in chile, herbs,
            soy sauce, vinegar, sesame seeds, pepper, salt, and sugar. Let
            dressing sit 10 minutes.
          </li>

            Meanwhile, cook noodles according to package directions. Drain and
            rinse under warm water to get rid of any excess starch.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer noodles to bowl with dressing and add butter and half of
            garlic crisp; toss to coat noodles. Divide among bowls; top with
            remaining garlic crisp.
