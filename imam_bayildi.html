    <h2>Imam Bayildi</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 medium sized aubergines</li>
      <li>2 large onions peeled, halved & sliced into half moons</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic peeled and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 handful parsley finely chopped, to garnish</li>
      <li>2 large tomatoes or 1x400g tin tomatoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Prep Time:</h3>
    <p>10 minutes</p>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Use a vegetable peeler to peel stripes down your aubergines. Now take a
        sharp knife and make a cut from the top to the bottom of each aubergine
        without piercing through to the other side. Gently heat your sunflower
        oil in a frying pan and add the aubergines. Turn them occasionally with
        tongs so that they brown and soften on all sides. Be careful as they
        will spit and sizzle in the hot oil. Once your aubergines have softened
        after about 15 minutes, remove them from the pan and place on a baking
        tray with the side where you made the cut facing upwards. Leave to one
        side to cool.
      </li>

      <li>
        In the same pan, add your olive oil and gently heat. Add your sliced
        onions and peppers and saut√© until the onions start to soften and turn
        translucent. Now add your chopped tomatoes, garlic, paprika, salt and
        pepper and mix together. Add a splash of water - about 50 mls - stir and
        leave to simmer for 5-10 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile return to your
        aubergines and carefully prise them open along the cut so that you have
        four canoe shapes. Now add your filling to each aubergine with a
        teaspoon - don't worry if some tumbles over the edge. It's all part of
        the meal. Dissolve your tomato paste (salca) into approx 150 mls of
        water and pour it over your aubergines and into the tray. Now place on
        the middle shelf of your oven and cook for 15-20 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove from the oven and leave until your imam bayildi is warm or at
        room temperature. Squeeze fresh lemon juice and sprinkle a little finely
        chopped parsley over the top of your imam bayildi before serving. Serve
        on its own or with accompaniments.
      </li>
    </ol>
