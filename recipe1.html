      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the spinach and blanch for 30
        seconds to 1 minute, then take it out with a slotted spoon or strainer.
        Let the water keep boiling to cook the noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the noodles into the boiling water, cover and cook for 1 minute.
        Stir them with a wooden spoon so they don’t stick together. Cover and
        keep cooking for another 7 minutes until the noodles are soft and chewy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat up a skillet over medium high heat. Add 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
        with the onion, the green onion, and a pinch of salt. Stir-fry about 2
        minutes until the onion looks a little translucent. Transfer to the
        noodle bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat up the skillet and add 2 teaspoons vegetable oil. Add the beef and
        mushroom mixture and stir fry for a few minutes until the beef is no
        longer pink and the mushrooms are softened and shiny. Transfer to the
        noodle bowl.

        teaspoon ground black pepper, and 2 teaspoons of toasted sesame oil to
