        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Using an electric mixer in a medium bowl, whip together egg yolks
            and 1/4 cup/50 grams sugar until very pale yellow and about tripled
            in volume. A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters (or whisk
            attachment) when lifted from the bowl. Transfer mixture to a large
            bowl, wiping out the medium bowl used to whip the yolks and set
            aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the medium bowl, whip cream and remaining 1/4 cup/50 grams sugar
            until it creates soft-medium peaks. Add mascarpone and continue to
            whip until it creates a soft, spreadable mixture with medium peaks.
            Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks
            until combined.
          </li>
          <li>Combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
          <li>
            Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish (an
            8x8-inch dish, or a 9-inch round cake pan would also work here) with
            1 tablespoon cocoa powder.
          </li>
          <li>
            Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso
            mixture -- they are quite porous and will fall apart if left in the
            liquid too long -- and place them rounded side up at the bottom of
            the baking dish. Repeat, using half the ladyfingers, until youâ€™ve
            got an even layer, breaking the ladyfingers in half as needed to
            fill in any obvious gaps (a little space in between is O.K.). Spread
            half the mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfingers in one even layer.
            Repeat with remaining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone
            mixture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder. Top with
            shaved or finely grated chocolate, if desired.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for at
            least 4 hours (if you can wait 24 hours, all the better) before
            slicing or scooping to serve.
