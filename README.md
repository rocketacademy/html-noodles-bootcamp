# Rocket Academy Coding Bootcamp: Recipe Site

I made a simple dessert recipe site using only HTML. I used the listed HTML elements to create my site:

1. Semantic tags: <header>, <nav>, <figure> and <figcaption>, <main>, and <section>.
2. Anchor tags to create navigational links between pages.
3. Image tags linked to images stored locally.
4. Lists: Ordered and unordered.
5. Headings, paragraphs, line breaks, and <strong>.
