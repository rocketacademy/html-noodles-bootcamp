      <p>Ingredients:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pound dried spaghetti, such as DeCecco</li>
        <li>1/3 cup good olive oil</li>
        <li>8 large garlic cloves, cut into thin slivers</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>

        <li>1/2 cup minced fresh parsley</li>

        <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for serving</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Instructions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons of salt and
          the pasta and cook according to the directions on the package. Set
          aside 1 1/2 cups of the pasta cooking water before you drain the
          pasta.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, heat the olive oil over medium heat in a pot large enough
          to hold the pasta, such as a 12-inch saute pan or a large, shallow
          pot. Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently, until
          it just begins to turn golden on the edges-don't overcook it! Add the
          red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds more. Carefully add the
          reserved pasta-cooking water to the garlic and oil and bring to a
          boil. Lower the heat, add 1 teaspoon of salt, and simmer for about 5
          minutes, until the liquid is reduced by about a third.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the drained pasta to the garlic sauce and toss. Off the heat, add
          the parsley and Parmesan and toss well. Allow the pasta to rest off
          the heat for 5 minutes for the sauce to be absorbed. Taste for
          seasoning and serve warm with extra Parmesan on the side.
        </li>
