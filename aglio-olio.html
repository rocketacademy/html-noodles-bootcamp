      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
          the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm
          to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta
          bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold
          skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10
          minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble.
          Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes.
          Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Pour in hot
          olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the
          Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
        </li>
