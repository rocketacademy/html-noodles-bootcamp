        <li>100 g (1/2 cup) of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>240 ml (1 cup) of milk</li>
        <li>

    </p>

    <h2>Preparation Time</h2>
    <p>
      30 minutes Chilling time: 3 hours
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Step 1: First, prepare the mascarpone cream. Separate the yolks from
          the egg whites and put them in two separate bowls. Then add 1/3 of the
          sugar to the egg whites and the remaining 2/3 to the yolks. Now whisk
          the yolks with the sugar until frothy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 2: Add the Mascarpone and two tablespoons of Limoncello. Then mix
          with electric whips at low speed.
        </li>
        <li>Step 3: Then whip the egg whites until stiff.</li>
        <li>
          Step 4: Finally, add the beaten egg whites a little at a time to the
          egg yolk and mascarpone cream. Mix slowly from the bottom up so as not
          to deflate the limoncello mascarpone cream.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 5: Grate the lemon zest and add it to the limoncello mascarpone
          cream. Stir to evenly combine the zest into the cream. Be careful to
          grate only the yellow part of the lemon. In fact, the white part may
          make the cream bitter. Finally, it's very important to use untreated
          organic lemons.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 6: Quickly dip the ladyfingers into the limoncello-milk mixture
          on both sides (about 1 second per side). These Italian cookies should
          not be too soggy. Arrange them neatly in the chosen casserole dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 7: Make another layer of ladyfingers. Keep going until the
          container is full. Finish with the limoncello cream on top. Let
          Limoncello Tiramisu cool in the refrigerator covered with food wrap
          for at least 3 hours before serving. You can decorate the limoncello
          tiramisu with some grated lemon zest or a few thin slices of lemon.
        </li>
      </ul>
