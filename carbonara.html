    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>350g of spaghetti</li>
      <li>200g of guanciale</li>
      <li>4 whole medium eggs</li>
      <li>100g (1 cup + 1 tablespoon) of grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
      <li>ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First, boil the water for the pasta while you prepare the carbonara
        sauce. Remember: 1 liter (4 cups) of water for every 100 g (3,50 oz) of
        pasta and 10 g (~1/2 tablespoon) of coarse salt per liter (4 cups) of
        water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the guanciale into small pieces (cubes, slices‚Ä¶ as you prefer) then
        cook in a skillet over medium heat for about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir
        occasionally so that it cooks evenly. The more the guanciale cooks, the
        more its fat will melt and its meat will become crispy. The level of
        cooking is up to you, depending on your taste. Some people like their
        guanciale well cooked and others prefer it soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        No need for oil: guanciale is already fatty, oily and fabulous on its
        own. If you want, you can add a tablespoon of cooking water and
        emulsify. This will create a great oily sauce to season the spaghetti
        nicely. When it‚Äôs ready, turn off the heat, cover with a lid and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now prepare the pecorino cream. So, in a bowl put the eggs and pecorino
        Romano cheese. Use the whole egg, not only the egg yolk. Pecorino
        Romano, the only cheese that is recommended for making carbonara, is a
        very salty and flavorful Italian cheese so there is no need to add salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add some freshly ground black pepper. Then, mix quickly with a fork ‚Äì or
        a hand whisk ‚Äì until you have a creamy sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        This egg and pecorino cheese sauce should be quite thick. Set it aside
        for the moment. The water should now be boiling so add the salt and cook
        the spaghetti.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now let go and they will fall in all directions. As they soften, use a
        fork to let them sink in, then stir. Cook the spaghetti al dente,
        following the cooking time found on the pasta package.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a spoon for spaghetti, drain the pasta when ready. Then place them
        in the skillet, over high heat, to season well with the guanciale.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the spaghetti and guanciale sizzle in the pan, TURN OFF THE HEAT,
        otherwise the eggs will overcook and you‚Äôll end up with scrambled eggs
        and pasta! Now quickly add the eggs and pecorino cream to the hot pasta
        and stir. The pan is not too hot, this way the eggs will cook without
        lumps. Pay attention to the consistency, which should be creamy, but not
        runny. If you notice that your carbonara is too runny, add some grated
        pecorino cheese. On the other hand, if you see that it‚Äôs too sticky and
        dense, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of cooking water. If you used a spoon to
        drain the spaghetti, the reserving pasta water may come in handy in this
        step.
      </li>
      <li>
        Authentic spaghetti carbonara is ready. So, with the help of a ladle and
        a fork, create a pasta nest and place it on a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the guanciale (what‚Äôs left in the pan), freshly ground black pepper
        and grated pecorino romano to taste. Serve and enjoy!
