    <ol>
      <li>
        Follow the directions of the Spaghetti (16 oz) package for al dente
        pasta, but subtract 1-2 minutes from what they suggest. We will be
        cooking this again in a frying pan so we want to under-cook the pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the noodles are done, pour in into a strainer and lightly rinse off
        the extra starch and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the Onion (1) in half, then and slice them into thin half moon
        slices and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the Dark Soy Sauce (1 1/2 Tbsp) , Soy Sauce (1/3 cup) , and
        Granulated Sugar (1 Tbsp) into 1 bowl and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the Beef (1.1 lb) thinly against the grain and put it into a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Marinate the beef with 2-3 teaspoons of the soy sauce mixture from step
        2 and Corn Starch (1 tsp) for 5-10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a frying pan (preferably a non-stick), add 2-3 tablespoons of oil and
        set it to high heat and wait for it to get hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the onions and cook it for 3 minutes until soft and golden.
      </li>
      <li>Add in the beef and cook for 3-5 minutes until it looks done.</li>
      <li>
        Add in the spaghettini and then add the sauce mixture on top of
        everything and cook for 2-3 minutes until everything is nice and brown
