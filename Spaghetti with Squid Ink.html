    <img src="Spaghetti-al-nero-di-seppie-3-of-3.webp" />
    <p>Preparation time: one hour</p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>500g (1 lb) spaghetti or other long pasta</li>
      <li>500-750g (1 lb) small (baby) squid, cut into small pieces</li>
      <li>2-3 cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped</li>
      <li>1-2 peperoncini, or a pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>A few sprigs of fresh parsley, finely minced</li>
      <li>A splash of white wine</li>
      <li>4-6 sachets of squid ink (4g each), to taste</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large pan, gently saut√© the chopped garlic, parsley and peperoncini
        or red pepper flakes in olive oil until the garlic is just beginning to
        turn brown. (Remove the peperoncini if using.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cut up squid, give it a good stir to cover it with the seasoned
        oil. Let the squid sweat in the oil, uncov ered, for a few minutes. Add
        a splash of white wine and cover, letting the squid simmer very gently
        for another 15 minutes or so, or until tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the squid is done, add the squid ink (along with drizzle of water
        if needed to keep things saucy) and continue simmering until the
        resulting sauce is thick and very black.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shortly before the sauce is done cooking, boil the spaghetti in well
        salted water until al dente. Add the cooked pasta, drained but not too
        well, to the pan and mix well so the pasta is well coated with the jet
        black sauce. Serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
