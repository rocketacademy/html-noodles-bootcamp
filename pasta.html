    <h1>Pasta Carbonara</h1>
    <img src="images/pasta.JPG" />
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 pound of beef tenderloin, cut into thin slices ½ inch x 2 inches and ⅛
        inch thick
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Marinade (for 1 pound of beef):</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup of crushed Korean pear (aka “Asian pear”)</li>
      <li>¼ cup onion purée</li>
      <li>4 cloves of minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced ginger</li>
      <li>1 chopped green onion</li>
      <li>2 tbs soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tbs brown sugar (or 1 tbs of brown sugar and 1½ tbs rice syrup)</li>
      <li>a pinch of ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tbs toasted toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>several thin slices of carrot</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation time</h2>
    <p>45 minutes</p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p><b>Marinate the beef</b></p>

    <ol>
      <li>Mix all the marinade ingredients in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Add the sliced beef and mix well.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Grill and serve</b></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        You can grill, pan-fry, or BBQ right after marinating, but it’s best to
        keep it in the fridge and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or
        overnight for a tougher cut of beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill over medium-high heat. Best is over an open flame on a grill or
        cast iron grill pan or skillet, but stir-frying will also work, if
        that’s all you have.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve with Korean side dishes (banchan) like kimchi as well as lettuce,
        ssamjang, and garlic cloves to make lettuce wraps, like I do in the
        video. Just put some meat on a lettuce leaf with some ssamjang and a
        clove of garlic, wrap it up and eat it in one bite! Everyone makes their
        own wrap, one by one, until they are finished.
      </li>
    </ol>
