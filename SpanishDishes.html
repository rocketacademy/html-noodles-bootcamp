        <p>
          Seafood is plentiful and popular in traditional Spanish dishes.
          <br />Spanish cuisine has also been highly influenced by the many
          international destinations in which Spain once conquered. <br />For
          instance, Spanish cuisine routinely uses Arabic ingredients such as
          rice, sugar cane, eggplant, almonds, and lemon in their cooking.
