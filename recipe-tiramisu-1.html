    <h1>Recipe: Classic Tiramisù</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><ol>
      <li>FOR THE CREAM </li>
      <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
    </li><li>½ cup/100 grams granulated sugar, divided
      </li><li>¾ cup heavy cream
      </li><li>1 cup/227 grams mascarpone (8 ounces)
      </li><li>1¾ cups good espresso or very strong coffee
      </li><li>2 tablespoons rum or cognac
      </li><li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
      </li><li>About 24 ladyfingers (from one 7-ounce/200-gram package)
      </li><li>1 to 2ounces bittersweet chocolate, for shaving (optional)</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

    <h2>Preparation Time</h2>
    <p>
      25 minutes, plus chilling
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p><ul>
      <li>Step 1: Prepare the cream: Using an electric mixer in a large bowl, whip
      together egg yolks and ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until very pale yellow and
      about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters (or
      whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl. Set aside.</li><li>
      Step 2: In a medium bowl, whip cream and remaining ¼ cup/50 grams
      sugar until it creates soft peaks. Add mascarpone and continue to whip
      until it creates a soft, spreadable mixture with medium peaks. Gently fold
      the mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined.

      </li><li>Step 3: For the assembly, combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl
      and set aside.

      </li><li>Step 4: Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish (an
      8x8-inch dish, or a 9-inch round cake pan would also work here) with 1
      tablespoon cocoa powder.

      </li><li>Step 5: Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the
      espresso mixture -- they are quite porous and will fall apart if left in
      the liquid too long -- and place them rounded side up at the bottom of the
      baking dish. Repeat, using half the ladyfingers, until you've got an even
      layer, breaking the ladyfingers in half as needed to fill in any obvious
      gaps (a little space in between is O.K.). Spread half the mascarpone
      mixture onto the ladyfingers in one even layer. Repeat with remaining
      espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture.

      </li><li>Step 6: Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder.

      </li><li>Step 7: Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for
      at least 4 hours (if you can wait 24 hours, all the better). Top with
      shaved or finely grated chocolate, if desired, then slice or scoop to
      serve.</li></ul>
