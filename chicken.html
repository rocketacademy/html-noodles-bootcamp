      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <h4>Chicken and shrimp broth</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Pace the chicken bones in a pot with cold water enough to cover all
          the bones. Skim away the scum floating on the surface. Add the
          peppercorn. Simmer over low heat for one hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir-fry the shrimp heads until fragrant and turn golden, which takes
          about 15 to 20 minutes. Strain the shrimp heads and keep the excess
          shrimp oil separately.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the fried shrimp heads to the chicken broth and simmer over low
          heat for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strain the broth with a strainer or cloth bag. Season with rock sugar
          and salt.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Others</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Simmer the chicken breast meat in the clean stock until it is cooked,
          which takes about 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Shred to become chicken floss.</li>
        <li>Poach the shrimp in the broth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>
          Slice the shallots thinly. Deep-fried over low heat until crispy and
          brown. Pour it through a wire mesh strainer to remove the excessive
          oil.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>To assemble</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Blanch the noodles, bean sprouts, and chives separately in hot water
          for 20 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Put the hot hor fun in a large bowl, top with the shredded chicken,
          bean sprouts, shrimps, fried shallots, chives, red chili, and
          scallions. Ladle the hot stock over the noodles. Add a teaspoon of the
          fragrant shrimp oil and serve immediately.
