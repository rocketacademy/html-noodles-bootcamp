    <h1>Homemade Chicken Noodle Soup</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        INGREDIENTS<br />
        2 tablespoons olive oil<br />
        1 cup carrots, peeled and sliced thin (about 1 1/2 large carrots)<br />
        1 cup celery, sliced thin (about 2 stalks)<br />
        1 cup sweet Vidalia or yellow onion, peeled and diced small (about 1
        medium onion)<br />
        2 garlic cloves, minced<br />
        64 ounces (8 cups) low-sodium chicken broth, plus more if desired<br />
        2 bay leaves<br />
        1 teaspoon fresh thyme (or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme)<br />
        1/2 teaspoon dried oregano<br />
        1 teaspoon pepper, or to taste<br />
        12 ounces wide egg noodles (or your favorite noodles or pasta)<br />
        2 cups shredded cooked chicken (use storebought rotisserie chicken to
        save time; or roast or cook your own <br />chicken in a skillet)<br />
        3 to 4 tablespoons fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely chopped<br />
        1 tablespoon lemon juice, optional<br />
        salt, to taste

        INSTRUCTIONS<br />
        To a large Dutch oven or stockpot, add the oil and heat over medium-high
        heat to warm.<br />
        Add the carrots, celery, onion, and sauté for about 7 minutes, or until
        vegetables begin to soften. Stir intermittently.<br />
        Add the garlic and sauté for another 1 to 2 minutes.<br />
        Add the chicken broth, bay leaves, thyme, oregano, pepper, and bring to
        a boil. Allow mixture to boil gently for about 5 minutes or until
        vegetables are fork-tender. Note – If you like brothier soup, add
        additional broth, possibly as much as an additional 64 ounces because as
        time passes the noodles will continue to absorb broth.<br />
        Add the egg noodles and boil mixture for about 10 minutes, or until
        noodles are soft and cooked through. At any time while making the soup,
        if the overall liquid level is lower than you like and you prefer more
        broth, adding a cup or two of water is okay. At the end you will adjust
        the salt level.<br />
        Add the chicken, parsley, optional lemon juice (brightens up the
        flavor), and boil 1 to 2 minutes, or until chicken is warmed through.
        Taste soup and add salt to taste. I added about 1 tablespoon but this
        will vary based on how salty the brand of chicken broth used is, how
        salty the rotisserie chicken is, and personal preference. Make any
        necessary seasoning adjustments (i.e. more salt, pepper, herbs, etc.),
        remove the bay leaves, and serve immediately.
