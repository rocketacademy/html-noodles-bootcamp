  Ingredients:<br><br>
2 cups of cooked rice (preferably cold, leftover rice works best)<br>
2 tablespoons of vegetable oil (or sesame oil for more flavor)<br>
2 eggs, lightly beaten<br>
1 small onion, finely chopped<br>
2-3 garlic cloves, minced<br>
1 cup of mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, bell peppers, or any other you prefer)<br>
3 tablespoons soy sauce (adjust to taste)<br>
1 tablespoon oyster sauce (optional)<br>
1 tablespoon sesame oil (optional)<br>
1-2 green onions, chopped<br>
Salt and pepper to taste<br>
Protein of choice: cooked chicken, shrimp, beef, or tofu (optional)<br>
Instructions:<br><br>
Prepare the Rice: If using freshly cooked rice, spread it out on a tray to cool before frying. Cold rice is ideal as it doesn't get mushy when stir-fried.<br>

Scramble the Eggs: Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan or wok over medium heat. Add the beaten eggs and scramble them until fully cooked. Remove the eggs from the pan and set aside.<br>

Sauté Aromatics: In the same pan, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil. Add the onions and garlic, sautéing until they're softened and fragrant (about 2-3 minutes).<br>

Add Vegetables: Toss in the mixed vegetables and cook for about 3-4 minutes until they are tender but still crisp.<br>

Add Rice: Increase the heat to high and add the cooked rice. Stir-fry, breaking up any clumps. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly, so the rice gets a nice, even coating of oil and flavors.<br>

Season: Pour in the soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), and sesame oil. Mix well so that the sauces coat the rice evenly.<br>

Mix in Protein and Eggs: Add in your choice of protein and the scrambled eggs. Stir everything together and cook for another 2-3 minutes to ensure everything is heated through.<br>

Garnish and Serve: Add the chopped green onions and give a final stir. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.<br><br>

Tips:<br>
Use day-old rice for the best results.<br>
You can customize the recipe by adding other vegetables or proteins according to your preference.
Enjoy your fried rice!<br>
