      <li>01 - Gather the ingredients</li>
      <li>
        02 - Set aside 2 tablespoons of flour. In a large, roomy bowl, mix the
        remaining flour with the cornstarch and baking powder. Season lightly
        with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        03 - Using a fork to whisk continuously, add the beer and the sparkling
        water to the flour mixture and continue mixing until you have a thick,
        smooth batter. Place the batter in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes to
        1 hour.

        04 - Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into a little less than 1/2-inch-thick
        slices, then slice these into 1/2-inch-wide chips. Place the chips into
        a colander and rinse under cold running water.
      </li>
      <li>
        05 - Place the washed chips into a pan of cold water. Bring to a gentle
        boil and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.
