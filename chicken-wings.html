    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 pounds chicken wings , halved at joints, wingtips discarded</li>
      <li>2 Tablespoons baking powder</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon cracker black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking time</h2>
    <p>1 hour</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Adjust your oven rack to the upper-middle position. Preheat oven to 425
        degrees F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a wire rack (I use a
        cooling rack) on top. Spray the rack with non-stick spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use paper towels to pat the wings dry and place them in a large bowl.
        It's important to dry them REALLY well!
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and baking powder in a
        small bowl. Then sprinkle the seasoning over the wings, tossing to
        evenly coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange wings, skin side up, in single layer on prepared wire rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake on the upper middle oven rack, turning every 20 minutes until wings
        are crispy and browned. The total cook time will depend on the size of
        the wings but may take up to 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from oven and let stand for 5 minutes. Transfer wings to bowl and
        toss with sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
