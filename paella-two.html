        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Rice: The perfect paella rice is a short/medium grain round variety.
            Here in Spain, Bomba rice is most commonly used, although other
            similar varieties like Calasparra or Senia are also popular.
          </li>
          <li>
            Seafood: Everyone's seafood paella recipe is a bit different, but
            usually, it will include squid or cuttlefish, shrimp or prawns, and
            shellfish such as clams and/or mussels. You can experiment with your
            favorite seafood or with what you have available.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stock: While some traditional paellas are made using only water,
            your seafood paella will be extra special if you use a good seafood
            stock. I like to make batches of homemade shrimp and shellfish stock
            for my paellas (lobster stock would also be amazing).
          </li>
          <li>Seafood: jumbo shrimp, mussels, calamari.</li>
          <li>
            Saffron: This gives the paella its distinct color and adds a mild
            flavor.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat the seafood stock and white wine with a pinch of saffron in a
            pot. Keep this warm until you need it later; the saffron will infuse
            into the broth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add olive oil to a large paella pan and start making the sofrito.
            Sauté the diced onion until translucent, and then add the minced
            garlic and sauté for a few more minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, add the diced tomatoes, paprika, and a pinch of salt. (If you
            are using a salty seafood stock, you may want to omit the salt.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir and cook the sofrito until it has a jam-like texture. The
            secret to a good sofrito is a bit of time!
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, add the squid (calamari). It can be cut into rings or chunks,
            depending on your preference. Coat the calamari in the sofrito and
            sauté for one minute.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now we add the rice! Mix it into the sauce and cook it for a minute
            or so.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the broth mixture to the pan, and don't stir! This is key: once
            the broth is in, no stirring is allowed. Simmer on low for 10
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the shrimp or prawns on top, and cook for another 10 minutes. If
            needed, flip the shrimp after 5 minutes to make sure they're pink
            and cooked fully on both sides.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the meantime, steam the mussels in a pot. Simmer a little water
            or wine, then add the closed mussels and cover. After a few minutes,
            the mussels will open. If any stay shut, simply discard.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the cooked mussels on the paella in a decorative way. When the
            rice has cooked for 18-20 minutes total, it should be done.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove from the heat, cover with a dish towel, and let stand for 3
            minutes. Serve with sliced lemon wedges.
          </li>
        </ol>
