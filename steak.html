  pan-seared steak recipe with garlic butter:<br>
  <br>
  Ingredients:<br>
  <br>
2 ribeye steaks (or any cut you prefer)<br>
Salt and pepper to taste<br>
2 tablespoons olive oil<br>
3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br>
3-4 garlic cloves, smashed<br>
Fresh thyme or rosemary (optional)<br>
1 tablespoon of lemon juice (optional, for a hint of freshness)<br>
<br>
Instructions:<br>
Prepare the Steaks:<br>
<br>
Take the steaks out of the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature (about 30 minutes). Pat them dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.
Season both sides generously with salt and pepper.
Heat the Pan:<br>

Heat a large cast-iron skillet (or any heavy-bottomed pan) over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and let it get hot, but not smoking.<br>
Sear the Steaks:<br>

Place the steaks in the hot pan. Sear for about 3-4 minutes on the first side, depending on thickness, without moving them to form a crust.
Flip the steaks and cook for another 3-4 minutes for medium-rare (or adjust the time to your preferred doneness).<br>
Add Butter and Aromatics:<br>

Lower the heat to medium-low. Add the butter, garlic cloves, and fresh herbs to the pan.
As the butter melts, spoon it over the steaks (basting) for about 1-2 minutes to infuse the flavors.<br>
Rest the Steaks:<br>

Remove the steaks from the pan and let them rest on a cutting board for 5-10 minutes. Resting ensures that the juices redistribute through the meat.
Optional: drizzle lemon juice over the steaks for a bright finish.<br>
Serve:<br>

Slice the steaks against the grain and serve with your favorite sides, like mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or a fresh salad.<br>
Tips:<br>
Use a meat thermometer to check doneness: 130°F for medium-rare, 140°F for medium.
Letting the steaks rest ensures juicier meat.<br><br>
Enjoy your perfectly cooked steak!
