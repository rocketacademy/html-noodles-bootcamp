    <h2>Cooking Time</h2>
    <p>55 mins</p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 2
      minutes.
      <br />Add celery and carrot. Cook for 7 - 10 minutes or until softened and
      the onion is sweet. Don't rush this step, it is key to the flavour base of
      the soup. <br />Add all remaining ingredients except the lemon and salt.
      Stir. <br />Increase heat and bring to simmer. Scoop scum on the surface
      off and discard (do this again during cooking if required). Place lid on
      and turn heat down to medium low. <br />Simmer for 35 - 40 minutes or
      until lentils are soft. <br />Remove bay leaves. <br />Thicken Soup: Using
      a stick blender, do 2 or 3 quick whizzes to thicken the soup (see video
      below). Or transfer 2 cups to a blender, let it cool slightly, then hold
      lid with tea towel and blend then transfer back into pot. <br />Add a
      touch of water if you want to adjust soup consistency. Season to taste
      with salt and pepper. Grate over the zest of the lemon then add a squeeze
      of lemon juice just beforeserving. Garnish with parsley if desired and
      serve with warm crusty bread slathered liberally with butter!
