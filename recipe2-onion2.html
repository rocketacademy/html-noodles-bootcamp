  <p>Instructions: 
    <ol>
    <li> Follow the directions of the  Spaghetti (16 oz)  package for al dente pasta, but subtract 1-2 minutes from what they suggest. We will be cooking this again in a frying pan so we want to under-cook the pasta.</li>
    <li> Once the noodles are done, pour in into a strainer and lightly rinse off the extra starch and set aside.</li>
    <li>Cut the  Onion (1)  in half, then and slice them into thin half moon slices and set aside.</li>
    <li>Combine the  Dark Soy Sauce (1 1/2 Tbsp) ,  Soy Sauce (1/3 cup) , and  Granulated Sugar (1 Tbsp)  into 1 bowl and set aside. </li>
    <li>Cut the  Beef (1.1 lb)  thinly against the grain and put it into a bowl.</li>
    <li> Marinate the beef with 2-3 teaspoons of the soy sauce mixture from step 2 and  Corn Starch (1 tsp)  for 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li> In a frying pan (preferably a non-stick), add 2-3 tablespoons of oil and set it to high heat and wait for it to get hot.</li>
    <li> Add in the onions and cook it for 3 minutes until soft and golden.</li>
    <li> Add in the beef and cook for 3-5 minutes until it looks done.</li>
    <li> Add in the spaghettini and then add the sauce mixture on top of everything and cook for 2-3 minutes until everything is nice and brown and evenly mixed. Serve and enjoy!</li>
