Classic Cheeseburger
Ingredients:<br><br>

1 pound ground beef (80/20 for best flavor)<br>
Salt and pepper<br>
4 slices of cheddar cheese<br>
4 hamburger buns<br>
Lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles (optional)<br>
Ketchup and mustard (optional)<br><br>
Instructions:<br>
<br>
Preheat your grill or stovetop skillet over medium-high heat.
Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions and form into patties. Make a small indentation in the center of each patty to prevent them from puffing up while cooking.
Season both sides with salt and pepper.
Grill the patties for about 3-4 minutes on one side. Flip them and add a slice of cheese to each patty. Cook for an additional 3-4 minutes for medium-rare, or until desired doneness.
Toast the hamburger buns on the grill for about 1 minute.
Assemble your burgers with toppings of your choice and serve.
