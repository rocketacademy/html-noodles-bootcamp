  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <h3>Julienne</h3>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Cut the greens into roughly 4" pieces and then thinly slice them lengthwise.</li>
    <li>Thinly slice the whites lengthwise. You should end up with approximately 4 ounces (115 grams) of light greens/whites and 4 ounces (115 grams) of greens after prep.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Fry</h3>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Heat an enameled saut√© pan or large non-stick pan over medium-high (my temperature is on the low end of medium-high). Add the oil, heat until shimmering, then add the white parts of the onion. Toss to thoroughly coat then spread the onions out in an even layer. The onions should have a solid sizzle but if they start to brown too quickly lower the heat. Stir frequently.</li>
    <li>Turn the heat off, tip the pan, and using a large spoon drag the onions away from the oil and press them gently against the side of the pan. This will drain most of the oil off of the onion whites. Promptly transfer the onions to a plate and set aside.</li>
    <li>Return the heat to medium-high and add the greens. Cook using the same process as above. The greens take about 5 to 7 minutes depending on how thinly they're sliced. When finished, turn off the heat, transfer the greens to the plate with the whites, and set the pan with the remaining oil aside. (Don't discard the oil in the pan.)</li>
  </ol>  

  <h3>Boil, Sauce, Serve</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Heat a large pot of water for the noodles.</li>
    <li>While the water comes to a boil, whisk all of the sauce ingredients together (dark brown sugar, white sugar, soy sauces, chili crisp, vinegars, and garlic) and then add them to the pan with the scallion oil. Stir to combine and adjust the chili crisp as desired.</li>
    <li>Cook the noodles just shy of al dente.</li>
    <li>Transfer the cooked noodles to a mesh strainer and rinse immediately under cold water. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat the scallion oil mixture over medium-high until warm to hot (the edges will just start to bubble) then add the drained noodles and half of the fried green onions (both greens and whites). Toss briskly to coat and incorporate. Continue to toss over medium-high until the sauce is mostly absorbed and the noodles are hot throughout. This process goes quickly - a minute or so.</li>
    <li>Plate and then divide the rest of the fried green onions between each dish.</li>
  </ol>
