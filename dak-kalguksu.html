      <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

      <ol>
        <li>Rinse the chicken thoroughly in cold water.</li>
        <li>
          Put the chicken into a pot and add the spice vegetables and the water.
          Boil it over medium low heat until the chicken is cooked (about 50
          mins to 1 hour). While cooking, scoop out floating oil and debris from
          the boiling broth as required.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the chicken is cooked take out the chicken and separate the meat
          from the bones and skin (keep the broth for later).
        </li>
        <li>
          Tear the chicken meat into bite size pieces. Put it into a mixing bowl
          and add the chicken seasoning then mix them well.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a separate pot, boil some water and add the noodles once it is
          boiling. Drain the noodles once they are 3/4 cooked.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the partly cooked noodles into the chicken broth and boil it until
          the noodles are cooked completely (about 3 mins).
        </li>
        <li>
          Put the noodles and broth into a bowl, add the seasoned chicken on
          top. Add the red seasoning sauce on top of the chicken and serve. (If
          you prefer, you can skip this red seasoning sauce and use the salt to
          flavour instead.)
        </li>
      </ol>
