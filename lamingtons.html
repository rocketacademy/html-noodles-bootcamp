        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Grease and line 20cm x 30cm tin, and heat the oven to 200C (180C
            fan)/390F/gas 6.
          </li>
          <li>
            Beat the butter and sugar for about five minutes, until really
            fluffy, scraping down the bowl regularly, then gradually beat in the
            eggs and vanilla extract until well combined.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl, stir in the salt,
            then, with a large metal spoon, gently fold half of it into the
            batter mix. Fold in half the buttermilk, then repeat with the
            remaining flour and buttermilk, until everything is well combined -
            if using milk, pour in only about 100ml to begin with, then add just
            enough so the batter drops reluctantly off the spoon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spoon the mix into the tin and bake for about 30 minutes, until
            golden and springy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove, leave to cool for 10 minutes, then turn out on to a cooling
            rack and leave to cool completely.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cut the cake into 4cm-square cubes, transfer to a baking sheet and
            freeze in a single layer for about two hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once frozen, remove from the freezer and start on the icing. Bring a
            kettle of water to a boil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sift the icing sugar and cocoa powder into a heatproof bowl suitable
            for setting over a pan of hot water, then add the remaining icing
            ingredients and enough boiling water (about 100ml should do it) to
            give the mix a smooth consistency similar to that of single cream.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set the icing over a pan of simmering water to keep it warm,
            stirring occasionally if it starts to thicken up. Tip the coconut on
            to a plate and spread out, then put it and a cooling rack on a
            wipe-clean surface near the hob.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spear a lamington on a fork, then dip it in the icing to coat and
            shake off any excess. Now roll it in the coconut, put on the rack to
            dry and repeat with the remaining lamingtons, icing and coconut.
            Leave to set before eating.
