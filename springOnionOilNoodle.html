      Step 1: Cut the spring onion into 8cm-long pieces and keep white and green
      parts separated. Cut into thin strips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Step 2: Place a large frypan on medium-low heat. Add the oil and white
      parts of the spring onion and let them soften into the oil, about 5
      minutes. Add green parts of the spring onion and allow to cook on low heat
      for 25-35 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. The onions
      are ready when they are golden and crispy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Step 3: Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Add the
      noodles and cook according to package instructions. Drain and refresh
      under cold water to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain again and
      then place them into a large bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Step 4: Combine the soy sauce, dark soy sauce and sugar in a small bowl
      and stir well until the sugar is dissolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Step 5: Pour the spring onion oil over the noodles, along with the soy
      sauce mixture. Toss to combine. To serve, sprinkle with sesame seeds
