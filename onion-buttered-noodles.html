      <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>1 3/4 pounds yellow onions</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons salted butter, at room temperature, divided</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>8 ounces long pasta, such as fettuccine or pappardelle</li>
        <li>1 to 2 garnishes (optional)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Halve, peel, and thinly slice the onions. Mince just enough sliced
          onion to yield 2 tablespoons, then set that aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add 2 tablespoons of butter to a large skillet over medium heat. Once
          melted, add the sliced onions. Generously season with salt and pepper.
          Cook until golden and jammy, 25 to 35 minutes, stirring often and
          lowering the heat as needed to avoid scorching; you can add a splash
          of water every so often if needed to deglaze if the onions threaten to
          burn. When they are done, drop the heat to as low as possible to keep
          warm.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, fill a large pot with water and set over high heat to come
          to a boil. When the water is boiling, generously season with salt,
          then add the pasta. Cook according to the package instructions until
          al dente.
        </li>
        <li>
          With the skillet still over low heat, use tongs or a slotted spoon to
          transfer the pasta to the skillet with the onions (and don't drain
          that water). Add the minced onion, remaining 4 tablespoons of butter,
          and Â¼ cup of pasta water, then toss everything together. Add more
          pasta water if needed to reach a sauce consistency you love, keeping
          in mind that it'll thicken as it sits. Toss in or sprinkle with a
          bonus or two, if you'd like.
