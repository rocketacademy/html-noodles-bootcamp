      <li>100g Icing sugar</li>

      <p>Instructions</p>
    <ul>
      <ol>
      <li>
        Place the flour into a large bowl. In a separate bowl, spoon out two
        tablespoons of your measured rice flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        and place in a separate small bowl. In the small bowl, add 10ml of the
        water and knead until the dough comes together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil some water in a small pot, add the small dough ball. Allow it to
        simmer for 3 minutes, remove the dough and place it in a bowl of cold
        water to cool down.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the large bowl add the icing sugar to the rice flour and whisk
        together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cooled down dough ball to the flour and sugar mixture. Knead the
        dough ball into the dry ingredients, while gradually adding the water
        (100ml). Knead until the dough is soft and smooth.
      </li>
      <li>Divide the dough into 16 even portions.</li>
      <li>
        Flatten out each portion into a disk, then place 2 tsps of the red bean
        paste in the middle. Carefully wrap the dough until it forms a ball by
        pinching the seams.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare two bowls, one with water and one with the toasted sesame seeds.
        Submerge the ball completely in the water, then roll it in the sesame
        seeds to coat. Lightly spray or brush the balls with oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat your air fryer to 160°C. Evenly place 8 sesame balls in the air
        fryer, being careful not to overcrowd it (they will expand). Air fry at
        160°C for 15 minutes, then increase the temperature to 200°C and cook
        for a further 3 minutes until golden. Repeat this step for the other
        batch.
