    <p>for the crepes:</p>
    
    <li>eggs</li>
    <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>2 1/2 tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/8 cup water</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp vanilla</li>
    <li>tiny dash of salt</li>

    <p>for the filling:</p>
    <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>2-4 tbsp powdered sugar (to taste)</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>fresh strawberry slices</li>

    <h3>Preparation Time</h3>
    <p>20 mins</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>for the crepes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk all the ingredients, except the flour, together. Add in the flour,
        a little bit at a time, whisking just until the flour has been mixed in.
      </li> <br></br>
      <li>
        Let the crepe batter rest for 10 minutes. Then, give the batter a quick
        whisk again before using.
      </li><br></br>
      <li>
        Grease a non-stick, 6" skillet with unsalted butter and heat over medium
        heat. Pour about 2-3 tablespoons worth of batter into the pan and tip
        the pan from side to side to get the batter to spread out throughout the
        pan.
      </li><br></br>
      <li>
        Cook each side of the crepe for 30 seconds before gently loosening up
        the edges with a large spatula. If it lifts, then the crepe is ready to
        be flipped. If it doesn't lift up very well, give it 10 to 15 more
        seconds and try again. Gently lift the crepe out of the pan, then flip
        over into the pan and cook the other side for another 10 to 15 seconds;
        remove to cool.
      </li><br></br>
    </ol>

    <p>for the filling:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>
        Simply beat the heavy whipping cream with a hand mixer or stand mixer until soft peaks form. Add in the powdered sugar and vanilla, then beat until stiff peaks form. 
      </li> <br></br>
      <li>
        Spread a layer of cream onto each crepe, add sliced strawberries, and then roll the crepe like you would a wrap.
      </li><br></br>
      </ol>
