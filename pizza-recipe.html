      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, water, yeast, salt, and 1 tablespoon olive together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Cover with a clean towel and let rise on the countertop for 4 hours, or overnight in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 F. Line a baking sheet with foil and grease with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Peel sweet potato and cut into quarters, then small ¼-inch thick slices.</li>
        <li>
          Add sweet potato and fennel to the baking sheet and toss with a splash of oil, salt, and pepper. Bake 26-28 minutes, until vegetables are
          fork-tender. Cool completely.
        </li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to a 9-inch cast iron pan. Stretch the dough into the edges with your fingertips. Let rise for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 F.</li>
        <li>While dough rises, cook the sausage. Add sausage to a skillet over medium heat. Cook 7-9 minutes, until no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Add two spoonfuls of tomato sauce to the top of the pizza. Spread it evenly with the back of the spoon, leaving a ½-inch border.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle on a handful of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Top the pizza with the cooked sausage, fennel, and sweet potato.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, until cheese is melted and crust is browned.</li>
        <li>Top the pizza with basil leaves and grated Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve hot.</li>
