      <li>

      </li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brandy (optional)</li>
      <li>8 slices (1 inch thick) French bread or baguette</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups grated Gruyere cheese</li>
      <li>Sprinkling grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Preparation Time</h1>
    <p>1 hour 20 mins</p>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Peel and thinly slice the onions from root to stem. There should be
        about 10 cups of sliced onions in total.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a 5 to 6 quart thick-bottomed pot, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil on
        medium heat. Add the onions and toss to coat with the olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the onions, stirring often, until they have softened, about 15 to
        20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase the heat to medium high. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive
        oil and the butter and cook, stirring often, until the onions start to
        brown, about 20 to 40 minutes. The amount of time will vary depending on
        your pot, stove, and onions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle with sugar (to help with the caramelization) and 1 teaspoon of
        salt. Continue to cook until the onions are well browned, about 10 to 15
        more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for a minute more.</li>
      <li>
        Add the wine or vermouth to the pot and scrape up the browned bits on
        the bottom and sides of the pot, deglazing the pot as you go.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring to a simmer, cover the pot
        and lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season to taste with more salt and add freshly ground black pepper.
        Discard the bay leaves. Add brandy if using.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the soup is simmering, line a sheet pan with parchment paper or
        foil and preheat the oven to 450°F with a rack in the upper third of the
        oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush both sides of the French bread or baguette slices lightly with
        olive oil (you'll end up using about a tablespoon and a half of olive
        oil for this).
      </li>
      <li>
        Put in the oven and toast until lightly browned, about 5 to 7 minutes.
        Remove from oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the toasts over and sprinkle with the grated Gruyere cheese and
        Parmesan. Return to oven when it's close to serving time and bake until
        the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, ladle soup into a bowl and transfer one cheesy toast onto the
        top of each bowl of soup.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alternatively, you can use individual oven-proof bowls or one large
        casserole dish. Ladle the soup into the bowls or casserole dish. Cover
        with the toast and sprinkle with cheese. Put into the broiler for 10
        minutes at 350° F, or until the cheese bubbles and is slightly browned.
      </li>
    </ol>
