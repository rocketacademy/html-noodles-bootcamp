          Rinse the fresh egg noodles with cold water, drain the excess water
          and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a small mixing bowl, marinate the chicken with all the all the
          seasonings in the Marinade, for 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat up a wok with 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil. When the wok is
          heated, add the chicken into the wok and pan-fry the chicken until
          slightly charred and blackened on both sides. Remove the chicken from
          the wok and into a bowl. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clean the wok and heat it up with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil.
          Add in the minced garlic and stir-fry until light brown or aromatic.
          Add the shredded cabbage and carrot into the wok and do a few quick
          stirs. Stir in the noodles, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and water.
          Continue to stir fry until the noodles are well blended with the
          seasonings and completely cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dish out and transfer into two serving bowls. Top the chicken noodles
          with the chicken (and its juice), garnish with the sesame seeds and
          scallion. Serve immediately.
