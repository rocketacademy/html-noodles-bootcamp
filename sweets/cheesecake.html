<ul>Instructions</ul>
  <li>
1) Put graham crackers in a large resealable plastic bag, and crush them with a rolling pin until very fine crumbs form.</br>
2) Pour crumbs into a medium-sized bowl; stir in sugar. Add butter, and stir until well combined.</br>
3) Press the crumb mixture into a 9" springform pan, spreading it 1 1/2 to 2 inches up the side; press flat. Chill crust in freezer at least 10 minutes.</br>
4) While chilling the crust, make the filling: Using an electric mixer set at medium-high speed, beat the cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the condensed milk a little at a time, scraping the sides of the bowl, as necessary. Beat in the lemon juice and vanilla.</br>
5) Pour the filling into the crust; smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.</br>
6) Unclasp sides of pan, and remove cheesecake.
