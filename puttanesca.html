          Bring pot of water to boil and salt it. Warm 2 tablespoons oil with
          garlic and anchovies in skillet over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring
          occasionally, until garlic is lightly golden.

          Drain tomatoes and crush with fork or hands. Add to skillet, with some
          salt and pepper. Raise heat to medium-high and cook, stirring
          occasionally, until tomatoes break down and mixture becomes saucy,
          about 10 minutes. Stir in olives, capers and red pepper flakes, and
          continue to simmer.
