  <ul>Assembly</ul>
<li>1) Remove the dough from fridge and roll out into a round and flat shape (about 22cm) - thin is imperative to ensure even cooking.</br>
2) Put a generous amount of mozzarella cheese in the center of the dough.</br>
3) Lay mashed potato directly on top of the mozzarella cheese center.</br>
4) Ali more mozzarella cheese to cover the mashed potato. At this point you should have 3 layers - cheese, potato, cheese.</br>
5) Close the dough up by pinching as you would close up a dumpling.</br>
6) Gently flatten the dough with a rolling pin to a diameter depending on the size of your pan. (Go as big as you can)</br>
 </li>
  <ul>Cooking</ul>
<li>1) Melt some butter in a hot skillet.</br>
2) Place the dough in seam-side down.</br>
3) Gently brush the top of the dough with more butter.</br>
4) Panfry over medium low heat until golden brown on both sides. You can flip this as many times as you want.</br>
5) Remove from pan, cut into bite-sized pieces and serve warm.</div>
