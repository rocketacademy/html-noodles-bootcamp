        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>225g softened salted butter, plus extra for the tins</li>
            <li>125g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>100g light brown soft sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>225g self raising flour</li>
            <li>2 tbsp milk</li>
            <li>toffee, chocolate or caramel pieces, to decorate</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Method</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter two 20cm springform tins and line the bases with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Beat the butter and both sugars in a bowl with an electric whisk for a few mins until lighter in colour and fluffy. Add the vanilla and the eggs, one at a time, adding a spoonful of flour and beating in between each egg. Add the remaining flour and milk. Divide between the cake tins and bake for 25-30 mins until they’re golden, spring back when pressed, and a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the middle. Cool in the tins for a few mins, then tip out and leave to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, for the icing, put the butter and icing sugar in a bowl and whisk for a few mins until light and airy. Whisk in the caramel briefly, adding 1 tbsp of boiling water to loosen, if needed. Set aside until the sponges are completely cool before assembling, or the icing will melt.</li>
            <li>Use half the icing to sandwich the cakes together, then spread the remainder over the top, smoothing it out with a knife or the back of a spoon. Leave in a cool place until ready to serve. Drizzle with the 3 tbsp extra sauce (warm briefly in the microwave if it’s a little stiff), allowing some to drip down the sides if you like, and scatter over the toffee, chocolate or caramel pieces to serve. Edible glitter, birthday candles or sparklers, optional.</li>
