    <h2>METHOD</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tsp oil in a large frypan over medium-high heat. Cook bacon,
        stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes or until golden. Add onion and
        cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until softened. Add rice and vegetables
        and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until warmed through. Add tomato and soy
        sauce and stir-fry for 1 minute or until well combined. Cover to keep
        warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk eggs and milk in a large bowl until smooth. Heat a medium
        non-stick frypan over high heat until very hot. Add 1 tsp oil and swirl
        to coat pan. Pour half the egg mixture into the hot pan and immediately
        whisk egg mixture with 2 chopsticks in a small circular pattern until
        there is a thin base of cooked egg but remaining egg is still slightly
        runny. Remove from heat and slide out onto a serving plate. Spoon half
        the rice and vegetable mixture along centre, then fold egg up over
        slightly to cover.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat to make a second omelette. Drizzle with tonkatsu sauce, sprinkle
        with sesame seeds and chilli, and serve.
