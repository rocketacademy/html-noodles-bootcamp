      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>
          Spread the pear slices on the sheet tray and toss with olive oil, honey, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Arrange in a single layer
          and roast for 12-15 minutes until soft and golden brown. (Keep the oven on for a later step.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, mix together the beef, remaining salt and pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and rosemary until just combined. Split into 4 sections,
          then split each section in half to make 8 portions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Form 4 beef portions into small patties. Make an indentation in the center of each patty and add about 2 tablespoons crumbled blue cheese
          into each.
        </li>
        <li>
          Form the remaining 4 beef portions into patties and place these on top of the cheese. Pinch the sides together and flatten as much as
          possible to seal the burgers.
        </li>
        <li>
          To cook the burgers, heat an oiled cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add the burgers and sear, pressing them down to avoid shrinking or
          separating, until browned, about 2-3 minutes per side.
        </li>
        <li>
          To finish the patties, place them on a sheet tray and warm them in the oven until cooked through and the cheese has melted, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          To build the burgers, line the bottom buns with pears, then top with a patty. Spread 2 tablespoons fig jam onto each patty, then add the top
          bun. Repeat with the remaining burgers and serve immediately.
        </li>
      </ol>
