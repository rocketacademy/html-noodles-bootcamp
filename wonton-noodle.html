    <p>Preparation time: 35 minutes</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>15 oz wonton noodles (fresh, unsteamed)</li>
        <li>30 wontons</li>
        <li>12 oz bok choy</li>
        <li>1 piece green onion</li>
        <li>8 piece shrimp (peeled, deveined)</li>
        <li>14 oz chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>0.25 tsp white pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>We'll start by washing and cutting our bok choy (12 oz) into quarters along the stem. Then, we'll chop our green onions (1 piece) into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Set the stove to high heat and bring a pot of water to a boil. Spread the noodles (15 oz) out and then dunk them in cold water for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>After dunking them in cold water, we'll place them in the pot again for about 15-20 seconds.</li>
        <li>For our broth, we'll add water (4 cup) and chicken broth (14 oz) to the pot, and bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>Cook the bok choy in a hot water with olive oil and salt added to keep its green color.</li>
        <li>We'll dump the shrimp in as we start plating the bok choy on top of the noodles. The shrimp only need about a minute to cook.</li>
        <li>if you're starting with raw wontons (30 ), you'll boil them in a pot of vigorously boiling water for about 3-5 minutes until they start floating.</li>
        <li>Transfer the wontons onto the bowl of noodles, and carefully pour in the soup broth. Garnish with green onions.</li>
    </ol>
