    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease and flour a bread loaf pan (9.25 long
        x 5.25 wide x 2.75 deep). Lightly roast walnuts on a skillet,
        continuously stirring so they won't burn. Coarsely chop and cool to room
        temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, cream together 8 Tbsp softened butter and 3/4 cup
        sugar (or honey if using honey).
      </li>
      <li>
        Mash bananas with a fork until the consistency of chunky applesauce and
        add them to the batter along with 2 eggs, mixing until blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, whisk together: 1 1/2 cups of flour, 1 tsp of baking
        soda and 1/2 tsp of salt then add to batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and mix in chopped walnuts and raisins.
        Pour into prepared loaf pan. Bake at 350˚F for 55-60 min or until a
        toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let banana bread
        rest for 10 min before transferring to a wire rack to cool.
