        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <lu>
          <li>
            Wash the collard greens then use a knife to chop off the stems. You
            can also use your hands to separate the leaves from the stems.
            Discard the stems (you only require the leaves). Grab a bunch of
            leaves with your hand, roll them up together then hold them firmly
            on top of a chopping board. Use a knife to chop or slice into
            ribbons. The cutting size will depend on your preference.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wash the tomatoes, peel and slice the onion and chop the tomatoes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, heat your cooking pot on the stovetop set it to heat under
            medium heat. Next, add in the olive oil and allow it to heat for
            about 1-2 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fry the onion until golden brown. Next, add the tomatoes and allow
            them to cook. The tomatoes should be totally soft. You can add a
            tablespoon or two of oil, if the tomatoes are sticking to the pot.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the tomatoes are totally cooked through, add the sukuma wiki
            leaves and some salt. Cover and allow it to reduce for about one
            minute then stir. Cover again and allow to cook for a further 5
            minutes. You can cook it longer, if you do not like your vegetables
            crunchy.
          </li>
          <li>Season with more salt or some pepper (if preffered).</li>
          <li>
            Remove from the heat and serve with ugali. For a low carb or paleo
            option, serve sukuma wiki with low carb fufu.
