      <p>Instructions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place a pot over water over high heat and bring to the boil. Gently
          place the eggs in the water. Stir the eggs every so often in the first
          few minutes to try to ‘centre’ the egg yolk. Gently boil the eggs for
          6 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold tap water to cool them down.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, mix together the marinade ingredients in a large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Carefully peel the eggs and place them in the marinade. Refrigerate
          for at least 4 hours or overnight. To serve, remove the eggs from the
          marinade. Slice in half and place on top of your steamed rice. Drizzle
          over plenty of the leftover marinade. Top with extra spring onion and
          serve.
