    <h2>Aloo Gobi</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 medium baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cumin seed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
      <li>½ head cauliflower, cut into florets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Prep Time:</h3>
    <p>30 minutes</p>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat in a large pot. Fry
        cumin seeds for a few seconds until they turn golden brown and begin to
        pop. Reduce heat to medium, stir in the onion, and cook until lightly
        browned. Stir in serrano pepper and ginger; fry for 1 minute. Season
        with coriander, paprika, turmeric, cayenne, and garam masala; cook for
        30 seconds until fragrant.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir potatoes and salt into the pot, cover, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes.
        Add cauliflower, cover, and cook until cauliflower steams in its own
        juices until tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in lemon juice. Pour
        remaining 1 tablespoon of oil around the edges of the pot. Increase heat
        to medium-high and fry for 3 to 5 minutes to brown, stirring gently to
        avoid mashing the cauliflower.
