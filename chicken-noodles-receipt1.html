        INSTRUCTIONS<br />
        Rinse the fresh egg noodles with cold water, drain the excess water and
        set aside.<br />
        In a small mixing bowl, marinate the chicken with all the all the
        seasonings in the Marinade, for 15 minutes.<br />
        Heat up a wok with 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil. When the wok is
        heated, add the chicken into the wok and pan-fry the chicken until
        slightly charred and blackened on both sides. Remove the chicken from
        the wok and into a bowl. Set aside.<br />
        Clean the wok and heat it up with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil.
        Add in the minced garlic and stir-fry until light brown or aromatic. Add
        the shredded cabbage and carrot into the wok and do a few quick stirs.
        Stir in the noodles, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and water. Continue to
        stir fry until the noodles are well blended with the seasonings and
        completely cooked through. Dish out and transfer into two serving bowls.
        Top the chicken noodles with the chicken (and its juice), garnish with
        the sesame seeds and scallion. Serve immediately.
