    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Make the anchovy and kelp broth: In a medium pot, combine the water,
        dried anchovies, and kelp. Bring to a low boil, then reduce the heat to
        medium low, cover, and simmer for 25 minutes. Strain the broth and
        discard the solids. Set the broth aside until ready to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the kimchi jjigae: Heat the vegetable oil in a medium pot over high
        heat. Add the onion, garlic, and pork belly and cook until the onions
        soften and the pork is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the drained, chopped kimchi and cook for 2-3 minutes, until slightly
        darkened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the Korean chile flakes, sugar, salt, reserved kimchi juice, and
        anchovy and kelp broth and stir well to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay the tofu and mushrooms on top of the soup and gently stir to
        submerge in the broth (do not break up the tofu). Cover the pot, reduce
        the heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat
        and season the soup with more salt to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ladle the soup into bowls and top with the green onion and sesame oil.
        Serve with white rice, if desired.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
