        <p>What is Mango and Sticky Rice?</p>
        <p>
          Mango sticky rice is a classic traditional Thai dessert, and in Thai
          it is called kao niew mamuang ข้าวเหนียวมะม่วง. Kao niew means sticky
          rice, and mamuang means mango. The sticky rice part of the dessert is
          made from white long grain glutinous rice that has been steamed and
          then macerated in a sweet coconut syrup. The rice is then topped with
          a salted coconut sauce and crispy mung beans.

        <br />
        <h4>Salted Coconut Sauce</h4>

        <p>2. 120 ml coconut milk</p>
        <p>3. 1.25 ml table salt</p>
        <p>4. 115 ml of water</p>
        <br />
        <h4>Others</h4>
        <p>1. 30 ml shelled and split mung beans</p>
        <p>2. 3 sweet, ripe mangoes</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Preparation Time:</h3>
        <p>20 minutes.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Preparation Time:</h3>
        <p>90 minutes.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Cooking Instructions:</h3>
        <h4>Sweet Sticky Rice</h4>
        <p>
          1. Wash the rice by placing it in a mixing bowl and cover with cold
          water, then vigorously swish the rice with your hand to release loose
          starch. Pour off the cloudy water and repeat the process 4 more times
          or until the water runs mostly clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Soak the rice with room temp water for at least 4 hours and up to
          overnight. If you're using naturally dyed water to soak the rice,
          refrigerate the rice after 4 hours of soaking if you're not yet ready
          to steam. While the rice is soaking, make the salted coconut sauce and
          the crispy mung beans (below). Note: There are 2 ways to colour the
          sticky rice: colour the soaking water OR colour the coconut syrup. If
          using natural dyes, it is easier to add the colour to the water than
          to the coconut syrup, because colours have a hard time infusing into
          fatty liquid. If using food colouring, then it will be easier to just
          stir a few drops into the coconut syrup.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Drain the rice very well, shaking off excess water in a sieve until
          there is no more dripping. Line a steamer rack with moist muslin (not
          soaking wet!) or a thin white tea towel and place the rice on the
          cloth. Fold the edges of the cloth over the rice, making sure the rice
          doesn't cover the entire rack - there should be space around the rice
          to allow steam to come up.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Steam the rice for 20-25 minutes over boiling water. Make sure the
          rice doesn't cover the entire rack - there should be space around the
          rice to allow the steam to come up.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. <strong>Prepare the coconut syrup.</strong> In a pot, combine the
          coconut milk, sugar, salt; and if you have a pandan leaf handy you can
          throw it in as well. Cook it over medium high heat, and at the first
          sign of bubbling, turn off the heat and keep covered until the rice is
          done. Do not let this syrup reduce.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. <strong>Macerate the rice.</strong> Shortly before the sticky rice
          is done, reheat the syrup back up so it is piping hot. When the rice
          is done, immediately place it into a mixing bowl and pour the hot
          syrup over the rice. Stir to break up any lumps, then cover with a
          lid, a plate, or aluminum foil and let sit for 20 minutes. It's very
          important both the rice AND the syrup are very hot to ensure proper
          absorption.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. After 20 minutes, fold the bottom of the rice up to the top to help
          redistribute the liquid, and let sit for at least another 20 minutes
          or until ready to serve. The rice should've absorbed all the liquid
          and looks plump and shiny, but not mushy. There should be no pooling
          liquid remaining.
        </p>
        <h4>For the salted coconut sauce</h4>
        <p>
          1. Stir the rice flour into the water until there are no more lumps.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Combine the rice flour slurry, coconut milk, and salt in a small
          pot. Cook over medium high heat, stirring constantly, until the
          mixture comes to a boil. Remove from heat and pour into a bowl. Let
          cool completely before serving.
        </p>
        <h4>For the crispy mung beans:</h4>
        <p>
          1. Rinse the beans in cold water and add them to a small pot and cover
          with about 2 cups of water.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Over medium heat, bring the water to a simmer. Once simmering,
          immediately remove from the heat and cover the pot for 10 minutes
          ONLY. Do not over-soak.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Drain off the cooking water and rinse the beans in cold water. Lay
          the beans on a paper towel to dry.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. In a lightly greased sauté pan, toast the beans over medium high
          heat, stirring frequently until the beans are dry, crunchy and start
          developing a light golden colour.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Let cool on a plate. This can be kept in an airtight container for
          up to 1 month.
        </p>
        <h4>Assembly:</h4>
        <p>
          1. Serve the rice beside sweet, fresh cut mangoes. Spoon some salted
          coconut sauce over the rice and sprinkle with the crispy mung beans.
        </p>
        <p>2. Drizzle condensed milk over top and serve right away.</p>
