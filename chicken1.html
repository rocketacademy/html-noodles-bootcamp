      <p>Instructions</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. In a large bowl, mix together the crème fraiche, single cream, eggs and half the cheeses. Season and set aside. Kids will love doing this.
</li>
        <li>Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the spaghetti until it is almost cooked but still with a good bite – 2 or 3 minutes less than the suggested cooking time on the packet. Drain, run under cold water to stop it cooking, drain again and set aside.
</li>
        <li>Heat a dash of olive oil in a 24cm ovenproof frying pan, add the onion and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until softened. Add the bacon and fry for another 3-4 minutes, or until golden. Add the spinach and allow to wilt for a minute or 2. Remove from the heat, then mix this and the cooked spaghetti with the cream mix. Kids will love mixing everything together in a big bowl.
</li>
        <li>Add a little more olive oil to the frying pan, tip in the mixture and level the surface. Top with the remaining cheese and the halved cherry tomatoes. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden on top and the filling has almost set. Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the frying pan for 10 minutes.
</li>
        <li>Slide out onto a serving plate and cut into wedges. Serve with a green salad.
</li>
        <li>Throw into bin</li>
