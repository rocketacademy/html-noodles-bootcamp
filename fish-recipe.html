        Clean the fish and pat it dry with paper towels. Make a few slits on
        both sides of the fish.

        Place the ginger slices and half of the scallions on a heatproof plate
        that fits inside a steamer basket. Place the fish on top of the ginger
        and scallions.

        In a small bowl, whisk together the vegetable oil, soy sauce, rice wine
        or sherry, sugar, sesame oil, and cornstarch. Pour the mixture over the
        fish.

        Bring a pot of water to a boil. Place the steamer basket over the pot
        and steam the fish for 12-15 minutes, until cooked through.
      </li>

        Carefully remove the plate from the steamer basket and discard the
        ginger and scallions.

        Garnish the fish with the remaining scallions and cilantro leaves.
