    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>

      <li>
        Set aside 2 tablespoons of flour. In a large, roomy bowl, mix the
        remaining flour with the cornstarch and baking powder. Season lightly
        with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper.
      </li>

      <li>
        Using a fork to whisk continuously, add the beer and the sparkling water
        to the flour mixture and continue mixing until you have a thick, smooth
        batter. Place the batter in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
      </li>

      <li>
        Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into a little less than 1/2-inch-thick
        slices, then slice these into 1/2-inch-wide chips. Place the chips into
        a colander and rinse under cold running water.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place the washed chips into a pan of cold water. Bring to a gentle boil
        and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Drain carefully through a colander, then dry with paper towels. Keep in
        the fridge covered with paper towels until needed.
      </li>

      <li>
        Meanwhile, lay the fish fillets on a paper towel and pat dry. Season
        lightly with a little sea salt.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat the oil to 350 F in a deep-fat fryer or large, deep saucepan. Cook
        the chips a few handfuls at a time in the oil for about 2 minutes. Do
        not brown them. Once the chips are slightly cooked, remove them from the
        oil and drain. Keep to one side.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place the 2 tablespoons of flour reserved from the batter mix into a
        shallow bowl. Toss each fish fillet in the flour and shake off any
        excess.
      </li>

      <li>Dip into the batter, coating the entire fillet.</li>

      <li>
        Check that the oil temperature is still 350 F. Carefully lower each
        fillet into the hot oil. Fry for approximately 8 minutes, or until the
        batter is crisp and golden, turning the fillets from time to time with a
        large slotted spoon.
      </li>

      <li>
        Once cooked, remove the fillets from the hot oil and drain on paper
        towels. Sprinkle with salt. Cover with greaseproof paper (parchment
        paper) and keep hot.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat the oil to 400 F, then cook the chips until golden and crisp, or
        about 5 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain. Season with salt.
      </li>

      <li>
        Serve immediately with the hot fish accompanied by your favorite
        condiment.
      </li>
