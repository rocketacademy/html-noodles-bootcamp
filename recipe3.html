      <p>Instructions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. Rinse the bean sprouts in cold
          water and drain. Julienne the scallions. Mix the soy sauces, sesame
          oil, salt, sugar, wine and white pepper in a small bowl and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Boil the noodles. Fresh noodles should be boiled for about 1 minute.
          For dried noodles, boil for 2 minutes. Rinse in cold water and drain
          very well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the wok over high heat and add a tablespoon of oil to coat the
          wok (you can also use a cast iron or non-stick pan for this). Spread
          the noodles in a thin, even layer on the wok and tilt the wok in a
          circular motion to distribute the oil and crisp the bottom layer of
          the noodles evenly. It should take about 5 minutes for the first side.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flip the noodles over. add another tablespoon of oil around the
          perimeter of the wok, and let the other side crisp up. Don’t stress if
          you can’t turn the noodles over in one shot. The goal here is just to
          get an even crispness and to dry out the noodles during this cooking
          stage. Set the noodles aside on a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the wok over high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil and all of the
          white parts of the scallion to the pan. Cook for about 15 seconds.
          Next, add the noodles to the wok and toss them well, breaking up the
          noodles so they’re not all in one big clump. Add the soy sauce mixture
          and toss continuously for a couple minutes. Keep the heat on high.
        </li>
        <li>
          After the noodles are uniformly golden brown, add the bean sprouts and
          toss. Add the rest of the scallions and toss the mixture again for
          another 1 to 2 minutes until you see the bean sprouts just starting to
          turn transparent. You want the sprouts to be cooked but still crunchy.
        </li>
