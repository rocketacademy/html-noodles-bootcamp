        STEP 1 Heat the oil in a large pan over a medium heat and fry the onions
        and garlic for 5 mins, then add the celery and peppers. Fry for another
        5 mins, adding the smoked paprika in the last minute. Stir in the
        tomatoes, oregano and stock. Bring to the boil.

        Tip in the penne, green beans and kale, bring back to the boil and cook
        over a medium heat for 10 mins. Stir in the cherry tomatoes and basil,
