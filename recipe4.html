      <p>Instructions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat oil and butter in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium
          until butter is melted. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring
          occasionally, until very tender and deeply golden brown, about 30
          minutes. (Stop before the onions become dry and shriveled.) Add red
          pepper flakes (if using) and 1 1/2 tsp. salt. Remove pot from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring
          occasionally, until al dente. Reserve 1 1/2 cups pasta cooking liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a small bowl, combine the oyster sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil,
          sugar, salt, white pepper, and hot chicken stock. In another bowl, mix
          the 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water into a slurry
          and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add pasta and 1 cup pasta cooking liquid to onion mixture and stir to
          combine. Add a small handful of cheese and stir until melted. Repeat
          with remaining cheese, adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed to
          create a glossy sauce that coats the pasta. Stir in parsley (if
          using).
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide pasta among bowls. Top with Parmesan, parsley, and a few cranks
          of pepper.
        </li>
      </ol>
