        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pork belly - my recipe uses tiny pieces of juicy pork belly which
            become tender as they cook.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spice Bag - we make a simple spice bag with a few fragrant
            ingredients: star anise, fresh ginger, bay leaves, orange peel,
            Sichuan peppercorns and a cinnamon stick.
          </li>
          <li>Onion, mushroom, garlic give a depth to the sauce.</li>
          <li>
            Seasonings - sugar, soy sauce, black vinegar, Shaoxing cooking wine
            and 5-spice all add their unique character to the sauce and create
            the complex umami flavour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Garnishes - The all important egg is a must have and I love the
            addition of crispy shallots. I buy them pre-fried and try to stop
            myself eating handfuls before I've cooked the dish!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>Fry the onion, mushroom and garlic together until soft.</li>
          <li>Add the pork belly and sear for a few minutes.</li>
          <li>
            Add the spice bag with the whole spices in it, and the other
            ingredients along with some water and simmer for 1 hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Boil some eggs for 8 minutes, peel them and add to the sauce. Cook
            for another 40 minutes. The egg will take on the colour of the
            sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simply add some cooked rice to the bottom of a bowl and spoon over
            some of the meat and sauce, and it's ready to serve!
          </li>
        </ol>
