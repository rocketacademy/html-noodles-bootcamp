      <p>Instructions:</p>
      <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Melt butter in a large pot...</li>
        <li>
          Unwrap caramel squares and cut each square into fours. Then, roll each
          small caramel square into a ball.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk 8 ½ ounces of flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1 teaspoon
          of kosher salt. Set aside for later.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a separate bowl, place 2 sticks of unsalted butter (room
          temperature), ¾ cup of granulated sugar, and a firmly packed ¾ cup of
          brown sugar. Using a stand mixer, mix the ingredients together and add
          1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
        </li>
        <li>
          After about one minute or after all of the ingredients are mixed
          together, add 2 large eggs to the mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix for about 1-2 minutes or
          until the mixture is a creamy texture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scrape down the sides of the bowl one last time and then add the dry
          ingredients to the mixture. Mix for no more than 30-45 seconds. Be
          sure not to over mix unless you want tough cookies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add your chopped up caramel squares, chocolate chips, and peanut
          butter chips to the mixture. Make sure to scrape the cookie dough out
          of the paddle attachment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a tiny ice cream scoop or melon baller to scoop out uniform little
          nubbins (1 Tablespoon worth) of the cookie dough and space out the
          scoops evenly on a parchment lined baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Place into a 375°F oven for 10-12 minutes.</li>
        <li>
          After taking the cookies out of the oven, make sure not to try and
          scrape the cookies off the parchment paper until they are cooled
          completely as the molten caramel will make the cookies stick to the
          paper like glue.
        </li>
