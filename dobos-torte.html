    <p><b>Preparation time:</b> 30 mins</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>9 egg whites</li>
      <li>8 egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>¼ cup milk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ tablespoon shortening</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 recipe chocolate buttercream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Have ready two 10-inch
        cardboard circles. Generously grease a 9-inch springform pan with soft
        butter, and dust with flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat the egg whites until frothy, and gradually add 1 cup sugar. Beat
        just to soft peaks. In another bowl, beat the yolks with the milk, lemon
        peel, vanilla, and salt. Fold this into the egg whites. Sift the flour
        over the egg mixture, and fold in.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 1 1/3 cups batter into the prepared pan. Bake for about 5 to 9
        minutes, or until small, brown spots begin to appear on cake. Remove the
        cake from the oven, and remove layer from pan with a spatula. Dust the
        cake lightly with flour, and place on a rack to cool. Grease pan again,
        and repeat this process until all of the batter is used, about 6 times
        more. Place the layers between wax paper, and cover with a towel. Chill
        layers for a few hours. Make the chocolate buttercream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer the chilled layers on one of the cardboard rounds with the
        buttercream. Start with one layer; cover with the buttercream, and then
        press down with another layer to make a good seal. Repeat this with the
        remaining layers, but reserve one layer. Wrap the cake in plastic, and
        chill for at least 6 hours along with the remaining buttercream. Grease
        the other cardboard round with the shortening, and place the last layer
        on it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 1 cup sugar into a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Allow sugar
        to cook until the edges look melted and brown. Begin stirring with a
        wooden spoon. Cook until the sugar become an amber color, and is smooth.
        Carefully pour the caramel over the top of the last layer, and spread to
        the edges with an oiled knife. Quickly, using an oiled knife, indent the
        top of the caramel into 16 wedges. Allow to cool slightly, and then
        retouch the indents with the knife again. Place layer onto a counter top
        dusted with sugar, and allow the caramel to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place some more buttercream on top of the chilled torte, and top with
        the caramel round. Frost the sides with the remaining buttercream. Chill
        the torte before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
